FerretDB was founded to become the de-facto open-source substitute to MongoDB.
FerretDB is an open-source proxy, converting the MongoDB 5.0+ wire protocol queries to SQL -
using PostgreSQL or SQLite as a database engine.

## Why do we need FerretDB?

MongoDB was originally an eye-opening technology for many of us developers,
empowering us to build applications faster than using relational databases.
In its early days, its ease-to-use and well-documented drivers made MongoDB one of the simplest database solutions available.
However, as time passed, MongoDB abandoned its open-source roots;
changing the license to [SSPL](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license) - making it unusable for many open source and early-stage commercial projects.

Most MongoDB users do not require any advanced features offered by MongoDB;
however, they need an easy-to-use open-source document database solution.
Recognizing this, FerretDB is here to fill that gap.

## Scope and current state

FerretDB is compatible with MongoDB drivers and popular MongoDB tools.
It functions as a drop-in replacement for MongoDB 5.0+ in many cases.
Features are constantly being added to further increase compatibility and performance.

We welcome all contributors.
See our [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/FerretDB/projects/2/views/1),
a list of [known differences with MongoDB](https://docs.ferretdb.io/v1.24/diff/),
and [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## This fork's Docker images

`.github/workflows/docker.yml` builds one multi-arch image from `Dockerfile.release`
and pushes the same `:<version>` and `:latest` tags to **three** registries, each
independently — so a registry being down never blocks the others:

| Registry | Image | Browse |
|---|---|---|
| Docker Hub | `wekanteam/ferretdb` | https://hub.docker.com/r/wekanteam/ferretdb |
| Quay.io | `quay.io/wekan/ferretdb` | https://quay.io/repository/wekan/ferretdb |
| GitHub Container Registry | `ghcr.io/wekan/ferretdb` | https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pkgs/container/ferretdb |

The release image uses `debian:trixie-slim` and includes `mongosh`, its C++ runtime
libraries and CA certificates. It defaults to the **SQLite** backend on
`0.0.0.0:27017` with state in `/state` and telemetry disabled.

Container targets are amd64, arm64, ARMv7, i386, ppc64le, s390x and riscv64,
provided the release contains the corresponding FerretDB binary and verified
mongosh package. ARMv6 and Loong64 remain standalone binary targets: the official
Debian runtime has no matching images. ARMv5 also lacks a mongosh runtime.
The build reports these omissions explicitly. QEMU runs target package
installation and checks FerretDB, Node and mongosh versions before publication;
the binaries themselves are still prebuilt. The separate source-build
`Dockerfile` remains a FerretDB-only scratch image.

Run the release-selection regression checks locally with:

```sh
mkdir -p .tools/tmp
TMPDIR="$PWD/.tools/tmp" bash integration/docker_mongosh_test.sh
```

Start the release image:

```sh
docker run -d --rm --name ferretdb -p 27017:27017 -v ferretdb-state:/state wekanteam/ferretdb
```

Use any of the three images interchangeably — they are the same build:

```sh
docker run -d --rm --name ferretdb -p 27017:27017 -v ferretdb-state:/state quay.io/wekan/ferretdb
docker run -d --rm --name ferretdb -p 27017:27017 -v ferretdb-state:/state ghcr.io/wekan/ferretdb
```

To use the PostgreSQL backend instead, point it at a running PostgreSQL — **both the
SQLite and the vanilla PostgreSQL backends of this v1 fork are confirmed working**
(see [wekan/wekan#6509](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/6509)):

```sh
docker run -d --rm --name ferretdb -p 27017:27017 \
  -e FERRETDB_HANDLER=postgresql \
  -e FERRETDB_POSTGRESQL_URL=postgres://username:password@host:5432/ferretdb \
  wekanteam/ferretdb
```

The other three v1 backends are **experimental** — runnable, not verified against a
live engine with the integration suite:

```sh
# MySQL, and MariaDB, which speaks the same protocol and uses the same backend.
# FerretDB creates one SQL database per MongoDB database, so it needs a user that
# may CREATE DATABASE - a grant on one database is not enough.
docker run -d --rm --name ferretdb -p 27017:27017 \
  -e FERRETDB_HANDLER=mysql \
  -e FERRETDB_MYSQL_URL=mysql://root:password@host:3306/ferretdb \
  wekanteam/ferretdb

# SAP HANA. The handler is behind the `ferretdb_hana` build tag; these images and
# the release binaries carry it, a binary built elsewhere may not.
docker run -d --rm --name ferretdb -p 27017:27017 \
  -e FERRETDB_HANDLER=hana \
  -e FERRETDB_HANA_URL='hdb://SYSTEM:password@host:39017?databaseName=HXE' \
  wekanteam/ferretdb
```

WeKan ships a Docker Compose file for each of them, with the same WeKan settings in
every one:
[SQLite](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) (the default),
[PostgreSQL](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/main/docker-compose-ferretdb-v1-postgresql.yml),
[MySQL](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/main/docker-compose-ferretdb-v1-mysql.yml),
[MariaDB](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/main/docker-compose-ferretdb-v1-mariadb.yml)
and [SAP HANA](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/main/docker-compose-ferretdb-v1-sap-hana.yml).

## Quickstart

Upstream also publishes an all-in-one image that bundles FerretDB, the database and
MongoDB Shell in one container, which is handy for quick experiments.

Run this command to start FerretDB with PostgreSQL backend:

```sh
docker run -d --rm --name ferretdb -p 27017:27017 ghcr.io/ferretdb/all-in-one
```

Alternatively, run this command to start FerretDB with SQLite backend:

```sh
docker run -d --rm --name ferretdb -p 27017:27017 -e FERRETDB_HANDLER=sqlite ghcr.io/ferretdb/all-in-one
```

This command will start a container with FerretDB, PostgreSQL/SQLite, and MongoDB Shell for quick testing and experiments.
However, it is unsuitable for production use cases because it keeps all data inside and loses it on shutdown.
See our [Docker quickstart guide](https://docs.ferretdb.io/v1.24/quickstart-guide/docker/) for instructions
that don't have those problems.

With that container running, you can:

- Connect to it with any MongoDB client application using MongoDB URI `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/`.
- Connect to it using MongoDB Shell by just running `mongosh`.
  If you don't have it installed locally, you can run `docker exec -it ferretdb mongosh`.
- For the PostgreSQL backend, connect to it by running `docker exec -it ferretdb psql -U username ferretdb`.
  FerretDB uses PostgreSQL schemas for MongoDB databases.
  So, if you created some collections in the `test` database using any MongoDB client,
  you can switch to it by running `SET search_path = 'test';` query
  and see a list of PostgreSQL tables by running `\d` `psql` command.
- For the SQLite backend, connect to it by running `docker exec -it ferretdb sqlite3 /state/<database>.sqlite`.
  So, if you created some collections in the `test` database using any MongoDB client,
  run `docker exec -it ferretdb sqlite3 /state/test.sqlite`
  and see a list of SQLite tables by running `.tables` command.

You can stop the container with `docker stop ferretdb`.

We also provide binaries and packages for various Linux distributions,
as well as [Go library package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/ferretdb) that embeds FerretDB into your application.
See [our documentation](https://docs.ferretdb.io/v1.24/quickstart-guide/) for more details.

## Building and packaging

<!-- textlint-disable one-sentence-per-line -->

> [!NOTE]
> We strongly advise users not to build FerretDB themselves.
> Instead, use binaries, Docker images, or packages provided by us.

<!-- textlint-enable one-sentence-per-line -->

FerretDB could be built as any other Go program,
but a few generated files and build tags could affect it.
See [there](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/build/version) for more details.
