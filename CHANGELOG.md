## Upcoming FerretDB release

### New Features 🎉

- **Docker Hub and Quay.io repository overviews stay in sync with README.md.**
  Neither registry updates its long-form repository description on its own, so
  the overview page had drifted from what README.md actually documents. The
  `docker.yml` workflow now adds a step, after the multi-arch image push, that
  reads README.md and pushes it as the overview: to Docker Hub via its
  login-for-JWT-then-PATCH `full_description` API, and to Quay.io via its
  `PUT /api/v1/repository/{repo}` `description` API, reusing the same
  `DOCKERHUB_AUTH`/`QUAY_AUTH` secrets already decoded for `docker login`. GHCR
  needs no such call: a package linked to a GitHub repository already shows
  that repository's own README automatically. Each registry is synced
  independently, the same way the image push already tolerates one registry
  failing without blocking the others, and no token is ever echoed or logged.
  README.md's own Docker links were reformatted as a markdown list so they
  render correctly as the pushed overview. `tests/docker-overview-sync.sh`
  pins the new step's endpoints, request bodies and the no-plaintext-secrets
  rule by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

### Fixed 🐛

- **Concurrent document modifiers preserve every acknowledged update.** Serialize
  mutation commands across connections for the entire query, modification and
  write, rather than only their final SQL replacement. Concurrent `$addToSet`
  and `$inc` operations no longer overwrite another client's changes, and a
  stale update cannot undo an account-disable change. Share the same boundary
  with namespace mutations, user writes and background TTL/capped cleanup;
  reads, handshakes and awaiting cursors continue independently. Queue waits
  honor connection-context cancellation. This is one server's mutation boundary,
  not cross-process transaction support. SQLite snapshot-controlled regressions
  cover concurrent updates, findAndModify, conditional filters, cleanup
  cancellation and failure release by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.73.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.73.0) (2026-09-07)

### Fixed 🐛

- **Release numbering stays on FerretDB v1 and advances one minor at a time.**
  Use v1.100.0 after v1.99.0, then v1.101.0, without promoting this SQLite fork
  to FerretDB v2. Remove the inferred increment from prior release gaps, retain
  the .0 patch policy, and reject a mistaken non-v1 release heading before
  changing the changelog or creating a tag. All three release workflows validate
  explicit and resolved tags before building or downloading assets, including
  completion of missing release assets. Regression tests cover ordinary,
  three-digit and patch-reset versions by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **PowerPC Docker images use a working, same-version MongoDB Shell runtime.**
  The packaged cross-built Node binary aborts during V8 initialization before
  executing JavaScript. Discover its version on the target architecture and
  download the official native PowerPC build with its published SHA-256 checksum
  and license. Reject version mismatches and retain JavaScript and mongosh smoke
  checks; regression tests cover version discovery and invalid checksums
  by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.72.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.72.0) (2026-09-07)

### Fixed 🐛

- **Docker release builds select platforms supported by their runtime.** The
  previous bookworm image had no matching manifest for several requested CPUs,
  aborting builds for every registry. Use trixie with CA certificates and the
  C++ runtime required by bundled mongosh; select its seven supported runtime
  targets and explicitly report ARMv6, ARMv5 and Loong64 container omissions
  while retaining standalone binaries. Download shell packages only for present
  supported server assets, fail on missing matching packages, and smoke-test
  FerretDB, Node and mongosh on the target architecture before publication.
  Regression coverage exercises full, partial, missing-shell and empty releases
  by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.71.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.71.0) (2026-09-07)

### New Features 🎉

- **Release builds include Android ARM64.** The same CGO-free embedded SQLite
  build used by the other portable binaries compiles for Android arm64, and
  release notes and regression coverage keep the new asset in the canonical
  target order by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.70.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.70.0) (2026-09-07)

### New Features 🎉

- **Release builds cover every additional native OS/CPU combination supported
  by the embedded SQLite stack.** Compile probes with the release Go toolchain
  add FreeBSD 386, ARMv5, ARMv6 and ARMv7, NetBSD amd64, and OpenBSD amd64 and
  arm64 beside the existing Linux, Windows, macOS and FreeBSD targets. The same
  probes reject AIX, DragonFly, Illumos, MIPS, big-endian PowerPC, unsupported
  BSD architectures, Plan 9 and Solaris where modernc SQLite does not compile,
  so the release list represents buildable binaries rather than aspirational
  matrix entries by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **Published multi-architecture FerretDB containers include MongoDB Shell.**
  The release workflow downloads architecture-matched packages and checksums
  directly from [wekan/mongosh-patches releases](https://github.com/wekan/mongosh-patches/releases),
  verifies every package before building, and exposes `mongosh` on `PATH` in
  each supported image. The release-all workflow can select an explicit shell
  release or default to the newest one. Static integration coverage verifies
  the repository, checksum and target-architecture wiring by @xet7. Thanks to
  xet7.

## [v1.69.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.69.0) (2026-09-05)

### Fixed 🐛

- **New and changed passwords can no longer create weak SCRAM-SHA-1
  credentials.** `createUser` and password-bearing `updateUser` now default to
  SCRAM-SHA-256 and reject an explicit SCRAM-SHA-1 mechanism. The MD5 password
  preparation and its ineffective CodeQL suppression are removed completely,
  resolving CodeQL alert 46 (CWE-327, CWE-328 and CWE-916). Authentication can
  still read existing SCRAM-SHA-1 credentials, allowing operators to migrate
  legacy accounts by changing their passwords. Integration coverage verifies
  SHA-256 creation and updates and both SHA-1 rejection paths by @xet7. Thanks
  to GitHub CodeQL and xet7.

## [v1.68.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.68.0) (2026-09-05)

### New Features 🎉

- **The FerretDB binary can verify an existing SQLite database without starting
  a network service.** `ferretdb check-sqlite <path>` opens the file read-only
  and immutable, runs `PRAGMA quick_check(1)`, prints `ok` only for a healthy
  database and returns a failing exit status for corruption, a missing file or
  a failed check. WeKan startup recovery can therefore use the exact SQLite
  implementation bundled with FerretDB on every supported CPU instead of
  depending on a separately installed CLI. The implementation and its tests are
  excluded from `ferretdb_no_sqlite` builds, which retain no SQLite driver
  dependency by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.67.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.67.0) (2026-09-02)

### Fixed 🐛

- **The mandatory SCRAM-SHA-1 digest keeps its narrowly scoped CodeQL
  exception.** Alert 43 reappeared when the query-specific annotations were
  removed, confirming that they must remain on the exact MD5 operation reported
  by CodeQL. MongoDB's legacy protocol requires that password-preparation step
  before PBKDF2-SHA-1, so replacing it would break compatible credentials rather
  than strengthen them. Source coverage now prevents another removal or drift,
  MongoDB-generated vectors continue to test interoperability, and new
  deployments should use SCRAM-SHA-256 by @xet7.
  Thanks to GitHub CodeQL and xet7.

- **FerretDB v1 now supports the maintained wire library and Go 1.27.** The
  wire 0.1.7 migration replaces removed document iteration, message-section
  decoding and indented logging APIs while retaining MongoDB document
  sequences and IEEE-754 NaN values. The test-event decoder accepts Go 1.27's
  `OutputType` and `FailedBuild` fields without relaxing its rejection of
  unknown JSON fields, and an integer diagnostic uses its correct format verb.
  The complete unit, vet and SQLite/TLS integration pipeline passes with the
  new toolchain by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- **The MongoDB v2 driver and tools gRPC library receive follow-up updates.**
  [PR #22](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/22) updates gRPC in the tools
  module from 1.83.0 to 1.83.1, and
  [PR #23](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/23) updates the indirect
  MongoDB v2 driver in the runtime module from 2.2.2 to 2.4.2. Module checksums
  verify and the complete unit, vet and SQLite/TLS integration pipeline passes
  by @xet7. Thanks to dependabot and xet7.

- **Runtime, integration, tooling and database-image dependencies are
  current.** [PR #18](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/18),
  [PR #19](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/19),
  [PR #20](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/20) and
  [PR #21](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/21) update OpenTelemetry,
  the SAP HANA driver, the wire library, test and development tools, Citus and
  MongoDB with their resolved indirect dependencies. Root, integration,
  release and container builds now consistently use Go 1.27.0. All module
  checksums verify, the tools tests pass with the race detector, and a binary
  containing the SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL and HANA handlers builds
  successfully by @xet7. Thanks to dependabot and xet7.

## [v1.66.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.66.0) (2026-09-01)

### Fixed 🐛

- **Logical OR filters no longer lose matches when a dotted path crosses an
  array of documents.** SQLite's direct dotted JSON accessor follows nested
  documents but not MongoDB's implicit traversal through arrays, so pushing
  such an OR into SQL could discard a matching row before the authoritative Go
  filter saw it. OR filters containing dotted paths now remain in Go. Positive
  collection coverage reproduces a nested session-token lookup, while a
  negative query-builder test prevents the unsafe pushdown and the existing
  scalar OR test retains the optimized path by @xet7. Thanks to jeremy-arsia and
  xet7.

## [v1.65.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.65.0) (2026-09-01)

### Fixed 🐛

- **Sorted queries with an effectively unlimited result limit no longer reserve
  memory for every possible result before reading the first document.** The
  bounded top-k heap now starts with a small capacity and grows only for rows
  that actually exist, preventing ordinary client queries from attempting a
  multi-gigabyte allocation and taking down the database. Positive coverage
  verifies correct ordering with the wire protocol's maximum default limit,
  while the existing finite-limit test retains bounded top-k behavior by
  @xet7. Thanks to jeremy-arsia, Heart1010 and xet7.

## [v1.64.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.64.0) (2026-08-30)

### Fixed 🐛

- **`$pull` now treats a document operand as a condition on each array
  document.** It previously required exact document equality, so a condition
  such as `{_id: id}` could not remove an element that also contained a value.
  This left a client's deselected custom field attached and made it immediately
  reappear. Positive and negative unit tests cover matching one field in a
  wider document, while database compatibility tests compare matching and
  non-matching conditions with MongoDB by @xet7. Thanks to Heart1010 and xet7.

## [v1.63.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.63.0) (2026-08-29)

### Fixed 🐛

- **A notified tailable cursor now returns its populated batch immediately.**
  `awaitData` previously filled the response after an OpLog write, looped, and
  waited for another notification before checking that batch. A lone insert
  could therefore remain invisible until a second write or the `getMore`
  timeout, leaving reactive clients one mutation behind. The filled-batch check
  now follows batch construction and precedes the next wait. Positive ordering
  coverage and a negative guard against the stale pre-query check pin the fix
  by @xet7. A restored large-dataset run confirms that board creation, reactive
  list updates and opening the new board now complete reliably; a small query
  delay remains but no longer blocks the workflow. Thanks to xet7.

- **Top-level `$exists` filters now run inside SQLite.** Missing fields map to
  SQL `NULL`, while an explicitly stored BSON null remains JSON `null`, so both
  `$exists: false` and `$exists: true` can be pushed down exactly while the
  Mongo-compatible filter remains authoritative. A startup existence probe on
  the restored 299,539-card collection previously decoded every full document
  for 20.6 seconds merely to return no match; its equivalent pushed-down scan
  completes in 20 milliseconds without building another index. Positive tests
  distinguish missing, explicit null and present false values; negative tests
  keep non-boolean `$exists` operands out of SQL by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **Numeric corruption checks now create a private scalar access path when the
  checked field is already part of a declared index.** SQLite cannot seek a
  non-leading compound key, so a field-only `$type: "number"` plus negated
  finite-range check previously parsed every complete document. On the restored
  299,539-card collection, the representative `sort` check falls from 1.31
  seconds to 17 milliseconds after a 1.26-second one-time index build. The
  Mongo-visible index definition and query remain unchanged. Positive tests pin
  eligible non-leading fields; negative tests refuse undeclared and hidden
  fields, bounding private index creation to client-approved schema by @xet7.
  Thanks to xet7.

- **SQLite indexes now cover BSON-aware filtered `distinct` scans.** Their
  original value expressions remain the first physical keys, preserving normal
  equality/range lookup behavior and Mongo-visible definitions, while each
  top-level field's SJSON schema is appended as an internal key. The planner
  selects the narrowest index containing the distinct key and every decoded
  filter field, so SQLite can deduplicate values, BSON types and filter inputs
  without visiting every document row.
  Existing eligible indexes are rebuilt transactionally once at startup and a
  persisted format marker prevents repeat work; unique and dotted indexes
  remain unchanged. When `FERRETDB_INDEX_MIGRATION_STATUS_FILE` is set, startup
  also publishes the current database, collection and index plus completed and
  total step counts through an atomically replaced, owner-only JSON file. This
  lets a supervisor report real progress without parsing logs or exposing
  document values. On the restored 299,539-card `distinct(listId)`
  workload, SQLite reports a covering scan and forced result construction falls
  from 2.96 seconds to 45 milliseconds (about 98.5%). The compound format also
  makes the filtered `distinct(swimlaneId, archived)` SQL a covering scan that
  completes in 176 milliseconds; its live non-covering stage previously took
  about 12.2 seconds. Positive tests cover new and migrated single/compound
  indexes, covering query plans and smallest complete index selection; negative
  coverage retains the former SQL for unique and dotted indexes, and verifies
  progress fields and file permissions by @xet7.
  Thanks to xet7.

- **Large SQLite result sets now resolve their column layout once per query.**
  The iterator previously called `database/sql.Rows.Columns`, compared newly
  returned name slices and rebuilt a variadic scan destination for every row.
  A 299,539-card scan therefore repeated invariant result metadata work nearly
  300,000 times, and distinct scans repeated it for every returned key. The
  iterator now caches one of its three supported layouts on the first row and
  dispatches directly to the matching scan. Existing capped-record,
  document-only, distinct and full handler suites cover every layout and error
  propagation by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **Building wide decoded documents no longer searches all fields already
  appended.** `Document.Set` now uses its existing key-count map to distinguish
  new fields from replacements, retaining replacement, frozen-document and
  duplicate-key behavior while making schema-ordered construction linear. The
  restored 299,539-card collection averages 31.3 fields per document. A
  representative 40-field SJSON benchmark improves median decode time by about
  8% without changing its 100 allocations or roughly 10.5 KB allocation size.
  Existing document mutation tests cover insertion, replacement, frozen and
  duplicate cases; the full type, handler and SQLite suites pass by @xet7.
  Thanks to xet7.

- **Nested SJSON documents and arrays no longer allocate streaming JSON
  decoders.** Complete-value unmarshalling preserves strict trailing-input and
  historical truncated-input errors while avoiding a reader, decoder and read
  buffer for every composite value recursively decoded from a result. The
  representative nested-card benchmark drops from 561 to 431 allocations and
  from about 44 KB to 31 KB per document, with median decode time improving
  from about 179 to 141 microseconds. Existing malformed-input tests and the
  SJSON, SQLite and command-handler suites cover compatibility by @xet7. Thanks
  to xet7.

- **Top-level SQLite `distinct` now constructs SJSON only after raw values are
  deduplicated.** The inner indexed scan collapses schema/value pairs, preserving
  BSON type distinctions and filter-field combinations, and the outer query
  wraps only those unique rows as minimal documents. SQLite's JSON subtype is
  explicitly restored across the subquery boundary so strings, objects and
  arrays are embedded rather than quoted. On the restored 299,539-card
  `distinct(listId)` workload, forced result construction drops from 3.60 to
  2.94 seconds while returning the same 41,875 values. SQL-shape and end-to-end
  tests cover the inner index/filter placement, JSON subtype, filtering,
  missing keys and duplicate collapsing by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **Large `distinct` results no longer perform quadratic BSON
  deduplication.** The handler previously called linear `Array.Contains` for
  every value even after SQLite had already collapsed most duplicates, making
  45,640 unique IDs consume about 15–17 seconds of CPU. Values are now gathered,
  sorted once as already required by the command, and compacted by comparing
  adjacent BSON values; the field path is also parsed once per command instead
  of once per document. The representative 45,640-value compaction benchmark
  completes in about 5–18 milliseconds. Regression tests cover stable ordering,
  cross-width numeric equality and duplicate strings, nulls, documents and
  nested arrays by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **Numeric `$type` checks combined with a negated range no longer decode whole
  SQLite collections.** The unchanged corruption-check selector
  `{sort: {$type: "number"}, $nor: [{sort: {$gte: low, $lte: high}}]}` now
  pushes its safe negated-range superset into SQLite. Finite numeric scalars and
  missing fields are pruned there, while string-encoded NaN and ambiguous
  strings, objects and arrays remain for the authoritative MongoDB-compatible
  Go filter. Across five restored ordered collections containing about 747,000
  documents, the check returns zero candidates in 1.9 seconds instead of
  spending about 30 seconds decoding every document. Positive tests retain NaN
  and array candidates and prune finite values; negative tests keep unsupported
  `$nor` shapes in Go by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **Repeated full-document SJSON decoding reuses schemas and lighter scalar
  parsing.** A bounded, concurrency-safe SHA-256 LRU cache retains up to 4,096
  hot immutable schemas no larger than 32 KiB, preventing unbounded memory
  growth without periodically discarding every common shape. On a restored
  299,539-document collection containing 16,377 schema variants, the larger
  LRU reduced a full decode from 35.1 seconds to 17.2–19.0 seconds. Common
  strings, booleans, integers, dates, timestamps and doubles now use strict
  scalar parsing instead of allocating a streaming decoder for every value.
  Full documents use the direct JSON decoder and preallocate their ordered
  field storage. A representative nested-card benchmark drops allocations from
  1,021 to 561 and memory from about 90 KB to 44 KB per document while improving
  median throughput by about 29%; tests retain malformed-input rejection,
  schema validation and NaN behavior by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **SQLite updates and deletes by `_id` now use the collection's unique
  expression index.** Their JSON path was semantically equivalent but
  syntactically different from the expression used to create the index, so
  SQLite performed a full collection scan for every write. The shared
  expression now matches byte-for-byte; a regression test pins it to the query
  builder's indexed form by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **Inclusion projections no longer decode fields the query cannot observe.**
  SQLite still parses and filters the unchanged stored SJSON document, but its
  iterator now recursively decodes only projected top-level fields plus fields
  required by filters and sorts. For a top-level `distinct` key, SQLite now
  constructs minimal SJSON from only that key and its filter fields and applies
  `DISTINCT` before rows cross into Go. Duplicate values, unrelated large
  payloads and documents missing the key therefore never reach recursive
  decoding. When a declared index starts with the distinct key, SQLite is forced
  to stream that access path rather than sort an unindexed table scan; nested
  keys retain the bounded decoder fallback. Small projections
  such as `_id` likewise avoid full recursive collection scans. The decoder always
  retains `_id`, including when its inclusion is implicit or it is removed only
  by the final projection stage, preventing partial documents from terminating
  a client connection. Exclusion projections retain full decoding. Unit tests
  cover SQL distinct collapsing, filtering and missing-key behavior, distinct
  nested paths, both `_id` forms, nested query-field collection, missing fields,
  stored field order and skipped nested values by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **DEBUGSPEED query shapes identify their originating command.** Slow SQLite
  diagnostics now distinguish `find`, `distinct`, `count` and `aggregate`
  without logging arguments or values, so two selectors with the same field
  names no longer lead performance work into the wrong handler. Existing
  privacy and small-query thresholds remain unchanged by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **Tailable OpLog cursors wake on writes instead of polling SQLite.** The
  OpLog decorator now broadcasts each successful append to every `awaitData`
  waiter. Cursors retain that notification generation and wait before their
  next query, eliminating the remaining once-per-second idle scan without
  missing a write racing with a query. Startup also repairs the missing public
  timestamp index on OpLogs created by older versions. Updates are emitted as
  standard replacement entries rather than an invalid whole-document `$set`
  containing immutable `_id`, so clients can apply them directly without
  repeated fetches. Unit tests cover broadcast fan-out, renewal, new OpLog
  indexes and old OpLog index repair by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **Positional projection follows predicates on fields inside array elements.**
  A projection such as `services.resume.loginTokens.$` now identifies its array
  element from a filter on `services.resume.loginTokens.hashedToken`, matching
  MongoDB instead of returning error 51246. Positive and no-match unit cases
  cover the nested predicate path by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **Indexed equality and empty-set queries no longer decode whole SQLite
  collections.** Boolean predicates are now pushed into SQLite, an empty `$in`
  becomes an exact false SQL condition, and compatible single-field expression
  indexes are selected even when MongoDB array semantics require an additional
  fallback arm. Top-level `$and` wrappers now push their usable conjuncts down
  and select the same compound index as an equivalent flat selector. This keeps
  unmodified client queries such as active-record, board-membership and empty-ID
  lookups on their declared indexes. Unit tests cover each pushdown and
  index-selection path by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **MongoDB 3.x index metadata restores no longer stop at the legacy `ns`
  option.** Modern `mongorestore` can forward that deprecated namespace field
  in `createIndexes`; FerretDB now ignores it as metadata instead of rejecting
  the remaining indexes after all documents have restored. An integration test
  creates and lists such an index, while a negative case proves unrelated
  unknown options still return `BadValue` by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

### New Features 🎉

- **BSON restores preserve NaN double values.** FerretDB now accepts the
  MongoDB-valid IEEE-754 `NaN` value on the wire and stores it through a
  reversible JSON-safe SJSON representation.
  Previously `NaN` terminated only the client connection, causing a bulk restore
  to stop at the first affected batch even though the server stayed alive.
  Codec tests cover its round trip plus an invalid spelling, and integration
  tests cover insert/read round trips, updates and find-and-modify by @xet7.
  Thanks to xet7.

- **DEBUGSPEED captures connection failures without recording wire payloads.**
  Opt-in diagnostic runs now default to `info`, so their log contains listener
  lifecycle, connection warnings and errors, plus the existing bounded SQLite
  query-shape records. Debug-level request messages remain disabled because
  they can contain user data. A unit test pins the opt-in level by @xet7.
  Thanks to xet7.

- **Opt-in SQLite query-shape diagnostics identify expensive pushdown work.**
  With `DEBUGSPEED=true`, completed SQLite cursors whose SQL execution, SJSON
  decoding or candidate-row count crosses a bounded threshold log the database,
  collection, filter/sort field names, selected index, limit, candidate count
  and separate query/decode timings. Filter values and documents are never
  logged, while small indexed lookups remain silent so profiling does not become
  the workload. Positive and negative unit cases pin all three thresholds and
  the disabled path by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- **The debug-command validation integration test follows the current typed
  parameter error.** It now pins both the rejected parameter and its expected
  string type instead of looking for the obsolete generic phrase `wrong type`,
  keeping the sequential all-tests workflow green without weakening the
  validation check by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.62.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.62.0) (2026-08-25)

### Other Changes 🤖

- **The legacy SCRAM-SHA-1 CodeQL exception is anchored in both supported
  forms.** MongoDB mandates this MD5 password-preparation operation for
  protocol compatibility. The modern `codeql` annotation remains immediately
  above it, while the legacy `lgtm` annotation now shares the reported line as
  that syntax requires. A source regression prevents either annotation from
  drifting away from alert 43 by @xet7. Thanks to GitHub CodeQL and xet7.

## [v1.61.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.61.0) (2026-08-25)

### Fixed 🐛

- **Aggregation result indexes are parsed directly at their BSON width.** The
  small-result path now uses a 32-bit `strconv` parse before constructing a
  BSON int32, rather than narrowing an architecture-dependent native integer;
  oversized synthetic indexes retain the existing int64 fallback. Native
  boundary tests, vet and 32-bit cross-compilation cover CodeQL alert 44 by
  @xet7. Thanks to GitHub CodeQL and xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- **Both supported CodeQL suppression forms mark the mandatory legacy digest.**
  MongoDB's SCRAM-SHA-1 protocol requires MD5 password preparation before its
  PBKDF2-SHA-1 derivation, so changing the digest would reject compatible
  credentials rather than improve their security. The source now carries both
  current `codeql` and legacy `lgtm` query-specific annotations immediately at
  the one digest operation reported as alert 43. MongoDB-generated test vectors
  still pass by @xet7. Thanks to GitHub CodeQL and xet7.

## [v1.60.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.60.0) (2026-08-25)

### Fixed 🐛

- **Aggregation indexes and range values no longer narrow without a local
  bounds check.** Numeric `$convert` type codes are compared at their original
  int64 width, `$range` checks every result at the conversion boundary, and
  array and code-point indexes return int64 when a native index exceeds BSON's
  int32 range. Boundary regressions and 32-bit cross-compilation cover CodeQL
  alerts 11 and 38 through 42 by @xet7. Thanks to GitHub CodeQL and xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- **The protocol-required SCRAM-SHA-1 exception is attached to its only digest
  operation.** MongoDB's legacy mechanism still mandates MD5 password
  preparation, but the implementation now uses one direct digest instead of a
  streaming hash whose reported sink was separate from the documented CodeQL
  exception. SCRAM tests continue to cover the compatible result for alert 6
  by @xet7. Thanks to GitHub CodeQL and xet7.

## [v1.59.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.59.0) (2026-08-25)

### Fixed 🐛

- **Readiness probes never write MongoDB passwords to logs.** Connection URIs
  are now redacted before both the initial debug message and the successful
  result, with invalid URIs replaced by a fixed diagnostic. Regression coverage
  proves that the password cannot appear in either representation, addressing
  CodeQL alerts 1 and 2 by @xet7. Thanks to GitHub CodeQL and xet7.

- **Aggregation operands remain fixed-width until bounds are validated.** Array
  element, slice, range and index operators now normalize attacker-controlled
  BSON integers before converting them to native indexes. Substring and date
  conversions use checked decimal parsing, and fractional `$convert` type codes
  are rejected instead of truncated. Extreme-value tests and 32-bit
  cross-compilation cover CodeQL alerts 7 through 11 and 31 through 37 by
  @xet7. Thanks to GitHub CodeQL and xet7.

- **GitHub tooling matches the complete hostname literally.** TODO, changelog
  and issue-client URL expressions now spell the dot in `github.com` as an
  explicit literal character, closing CodeQL alerts 3 through 5 without
  widening the accepted repository or issue syntax. The tools module also uses
  one `go-github` major version throughout, allowing its regression suites to
  compile and run again by @xet7. Thanks to GitHub CodeQL and xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- **The legacy SCRAM-SHA-1 compatibility derivation documents its required
  cryptographic exception.** MongoDB mandates an MD5 password-preparation step
  before salted PBKDF2-SHA-1 for this mechanism, so replacing it would invalidate
  existing credentials. CodeQL alert 6 is narrowly suppressed at that mandated
  operation, while the stronger supported SCRAM-SHA-256 mechanism remains the
  recommendation for new deployments by @xet7. Thanks to GitHub CodeQL and
  xet7.

## [v1.58.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.58.0) (2026-08-25)

### Fixed 🐛

- **Numeric query arguments no longer wrap during native-integer conversions.**
  CodeQL alerts 12 through 30 identified unsafe conversions shared by date-part
  construction, array filtering, substring and string-index expressions, and
  BSON timestamp formatting. Query bounds now remain fixed-width until they are
  safely clamped, date parts reject values outside the native range, filter
  limits stay 64-bit, and timestamp components are formatted as their unsigned
  BSON values. Extreme-value, fractional-value and 32-bit regression tests cover
  the affected paths by @xet7. Thanks to GitHub CodeQL and xet7.

## [v1.57.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.57.0) (2026-08-25)

### Fixed 🐛

- **SQLite honors the application's compound indexes for multi-field filters.**
  Mongo-compatible scalar equality also admits array candidates, and those OR
  arms could make SQLite choose an unrelated single-field index instead of the
  declared compound prefix. The SQLite backend now selects the longest matching
  declared prefix (preferring the narrowest index on a tie), while the existing
  in-Go filter remains authoritative for exact MongoDB semantics. Linked-card
  and parent-card discovery consequently use their respective
  `boardId`/`archived`/`type` and `boardId`/`archived`/`parentId` indexes by
  @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **Sorted limited queries retain only the requested result window.** A `find`
  with `sort`, `skip` and `limit` previously decoded and retained every matching
  document before sorting, even when the caller requested a small page. It now
  uses an exact BSON-order top-N heap capped at `skip + limit`, then applies the
  existing skip, limit and projection stages. Unlimited sorts retain their
  previous behavior, and mixed BSON types keep FerretDB's MongoDB-compatible
  comparator by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.56.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.56.0) (2026-08-23)

### Fixed 🐛

- **SQLite unit expectations follow the embedded 3.53.3 engine.**
  The `modernc.org/sqlite` 1.57.0 update in
  [PR #3](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/3) moved the embedded SQLite
  engine from 3.53.2 to 3.53.3, but backend-state, pool-version and source-ID
  assertions still expected the old engine. All four expectations now describe
  the binary actually built, and the complete `build.sh unit` stage passes by
  @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **FerretDB v1 builds against its compatible wire protocol library again.**
  The dependency batch in
  [PR #3](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/3) updated
  `github.com/FerretDB/wire` from 0.0.8 to 0.1.7, but the newer library removed
  `Document.GetByIndex`, `OpMsg.RawSection0`, section metadata and
  `wire.CheckNaNs` that the v1 BSON and handler code still uses. Root and
  integration modules now retain wire 0.0.8 while keeping the compatible
  dependency updates. Module graphs are tidy, handler tests pass and the
  FerretDB binary builds by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **The tools module no longer resolves a PKCS#12 decoder with an authentication
  bypass.** `software.sslmate.com/src/go-pkcs12` is updated from 0.7.1 to 0.7.2,
  fixing
  [GHSA-mpwr-8vm7-h73f](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mpwr-8vm7-h73f)
  ([GO-2026-5052](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-5052)). Versions from 0.6.0
  through 0.7.1 could accept a PKCS#12 file encoded with the wrong password when
  a PBMAC1 key was excessively short. The dependency is pulled in through
  nfpm and go-msix. Module checksums verify, the dependency graph resolves only
  0.7.2, and the patched package tests pass by @xet7. Thanks to Pavol Žáčik,
  Alex Gaynor and xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- **Dependency installation records the complete checksum closure.**
  Running the dependency installer and full test suite populated previously
  missing transitive checksums in the root, integration and tools modules.
  Committing those verified sums keeps a fresh dependency download reproducible
  and prevents a successful test run from leaving all three modules dirty. All
  FerretDB unit, vet and SQLite integration stages pass by @xet7. Thanks to
  xet7.

- **GitHub Actions move to their current major releases.**
  [PR #1](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/1) updates checkout, Go setup,
  Buildx setup, Pages configuration, Pages artifact upload and Pages deployment
  across the release, Docker, documentation and no-LFS workflows by @xet7.
  Thanks to xet7.

- **The FerretDB build containers use current Go and PostgreSQL images.**
  [PR #2](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/2) moves the all-in-one,
  development and production Dockerfiles from Go 1.24.3 to 1.27.0, and the
  all-in-one runtime from PostgreSQL 16.9 to 18.6 by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **The main FerretDB Go module receives ten compatible dependency updates.**
  [PR #3](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/3) updates the SAP HANA
  driver, Kong, Prometheus, Testify, OpenTelemetry and SQLite modules, with their resolved indirect dependencies by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **The tools module receives thirteen direct dependency updates.**
  [PR #4](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/4) updates the GitHub helper,
  Task, nfpm, dependency graph, OpenAPI generator, consistency checks, internal
  Go helpers, GitHub Actions helper, Testify, pkgsite, Go tools, vulnerability
  tooling and gofumpt, with their resolved module graph by @xet7. Thanks to
  xet7.

- **The integration module receives five direct dependency updates.**
  [PR #5](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/5) updates Prometheus, Testify,
  MongoDB OpenTelemetry instrumentation and the OpenTelemetry API and SDK, with
  their resolved indirect dependencies by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **The build dependency images receive eleven updates.**
  [PR #6](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/6) updates Citus, Prettier,
  textlint, Wrangler, Jaeger, the legacy Mongo shell, markdownlint, MongoDB,
  MySQL, PostgreSQL and Trivy images by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **The tools module updates jsonparser from 1.1.2 to 1.6.1.**
  [PR #7](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/7) refreshes the indirect JSON
  parser used by the tools dependency graph by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **The tools module updates CIRCL from 1.6.3 to 1.6.5.**
  [PR #8](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/8) refreshes the indirect
  Cloudflare cryptographic library used by the tools dependency graph by
  @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **The tools module updates go-billy from 5.9.0 to 5.9.1.**
  [PR #9](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/9) refreshes the filesystem
  abstraction used by go-git in the tools dependency graph by @xet7. Thanks to
  xet7.

- **The tools module updates go-git from 5.19.1 to 5.19.2.**
  [PR #10](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/10) refreshes the Git client
  used by release and maintenance tooling by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **The lint tools update mapstructure from 2.2.1 to 2.4.0.**
  [PR #11](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/11) refreshes the indirect
  configuration decoder used by golangci-lint by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **The main module updates the MongoDB Go driver from 2.2.2 to 2.4.2.**
  [PR #12](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/12) refreshes the driver used

- **The tools module updates kin-openapi from 0.142.0 to 0.144.0.**
  [PR #13](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/13) refreshes the OpenAPI
  implementation used by the tools dependency graph by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **Non-interactive build.sh calls without a command fail instead of looping.**
  [PR #14](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/pull/14) detects whether standard
  input is a terminal before opening the menu. CodeQL autobuild and other
  unattended callers now receive an explanatory exit status 2 instead of an
  endless read loop by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.55.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.55.0) (2026-08-23)

### Other Changes 🤖

- **The local test runner generates version metadata before unit packages load.**
  Unit tests imported `build/version` while `version.txt` still described an older
  checkout, so package initialization panicked before the tests could run even
  though vet and SQLite integration passed. `act_unit` now runs the same version
  generator used by local and release builds first. Standalone test logs also go
  to the parent WeKan checkout under `.tools/log`, matching runs driven by WeKan,
  instead of the removed sibling or repository `log` paths by . Thanks to
  xet7.

## [v1.54.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.54.0) (2026-08-17)

### Fixed 🐛

- **SQLite pushes document-form `$elemMatch` selectors into `json_each`.** Safe
  equality and `$in` predicates are now evaluated inside one correlated
  `EXISTS`, preserving the rule that every condition must match the same array
  element. This lets membership selectors narrow rows in SQLite before the Go
  filter rechecks them, while unsupported, dotted or unsafe inner conditions
  remain entirely in Go. Unit tests cover equality, `$in`, booleans and refused
  operators; an end-to-end backend test proves values split across two elements
  do not match by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.53.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.53.0) (2026-08-15)

### New Features 🎉

- **`$slice` and `$elemMatch` work in a projection, the same way on every
  backend.** A database-conformance run that asks each backend the same 100
  questions had two it could not answer anywhere: `find({}, {tags: {$slice: 1}})`
  and `find({}, {items: {$elemMatch: {k: "a"}}})` both came back with
  *projection expression ... is not supported*. It was the same answer from
  SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB because it was never a backend
  question - the find handler rejected EVERY document-valued projection before
  a backend was reached. They are implemented once, above the backends, so all
  four gained them together. `$slice` takes `n` for the first n elements, `-n`
  for the last n, or `[skip, n]` where a negative skip counts from the end; a
  field that is not an array comes back as it is. `$elemMatch` returns the FIRST
  element matching its condition and leaves the field out entirely when nothing
  matches. The distinction that decides whether the rest of a document survives
  is that `$slice` is neither an inclusion nor an exclusion - `{tags: {$slice: 1}}`
  alone returns the WHOLE document with that one array limited, while
  `$elemMatch` names a field to keep and cannot be mixed with an exclusion. An
  operator that is still not implemented, `$meta` among them, keeps failing
  exactly as it did rather than being quietly ignored, and the aggregation
  `$project` stage is untouched: it has its own projection with its own
  operators by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **`$meta` answers `recordId` and `textScore`, and says why it cannot answer the
  rest.** With `$slice` and `$elemMatch` implemented, `$meta` was the last
  projection operator MongoDB has, and the last one that failed as *not
  supported*. `recordId` returns the storage-level identity every backend already
  carries on a document it returns. `textScore` is counted from this fork's own
  `$text` matching - how many times each positive term occurs as a whole word and
  each phrase as a substring - so a document matching a term more often scores
  above one matching it less, which is the property clients sort by; the VALUES
  will not equal MongoDB's, which scores against a real text index with stemming,
  field weights and length normalisation that nothing here has. Asking for a text
  score when the query carries no `$text` is refused the way MongoDB refuses it,
  rather than answered with a zero. `indexKey` and `sortKey` are not available to
  a projection, and `searchScore`, `searchHighlights` and `vectorSearchScore`
  belong to Atlas Search - each says which it is and why, so a keyword that is a
  gap is told apart from a keyword that is a typo. Like `$slice`, `$meta` is
  neither an inclusion nor an exclusion: it adds a field and leaves every other
  one alone by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **The roadmap and the reference say what is supported now.**
  `docs/reference/supported-commands.md` had all three projection operators as
  ❌ against upstream issue links; they are ✅ / ⚠️ with a table of the `$meta`
  keywords beside them, and the `find` `projection` argument no longer says
  "basic projections with fields". `ROADMAP.md` gains a **Projection operators**
  block in the fork-work section and eight rows in the compatibility matrix, and
  its conformance paragraph no longer says two of the hundred cases go
  unanswered everywhere - it says why they did, which is that the refusal was
  never in a backend by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.52.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.52.0) (2026-08-14)

### Other Changes 🤖

- **The integration module's own requirements follow the toolchain that was
  raised in v1.51.0.** That release moved the Go toolchain to 1.25.12 and
  `google.golang.org/grpc` to 1.82.1 in the module that ships, and raised the
  `go` line in `integration/go.mod` with it - but that module's own requirements
  were left where they were, so the test module still resolved `grpc` 1.82.0
  ([GHSA-hrxh-6v49-42gf](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hrxh-6v49-42gf)) and
  `golang.org/x/crypto` 0.53.0: the versions that release says it moved off,
  fetched again by every build of the tests. They are 1.82.1 and 0.55.0 now,
  with `x/net`, `x/sync`, `x/sys` and `x/text` following, and both `go.sum`
  files carry what that resolves to - so a clean checkout builds what this tree
  builds instead of resolving it again and leaving the lock files modified in
  every working copy. Nothing that ships changes: this module is the integration
  tests. `go mod verify` passes in both modules, `go build ./...` is clean in the
  integration one, and the SQLite integration suite passes by @xet7. Thanks to
  xet7.

## [v1.51.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.51.0) (2026-08-14)

### Other Changes 🤖

- **The Go toolchain and gRPC are raised past their advisories.** A container
  scan of the published image reads what a Go binary was built with, and
  `ghcr.io/wekan/ferretdb:latest` reported three fixable findings: the Go
  1.25.11 standard library ([CVE-2026-39822](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-5876),
  [CVE-2026-42505](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-5877)), both fixed in 1.25.12,
  and `google.golang.org/grpc` 1.82.0
  ([GHSA-hrxh-6v49-42gf](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hrxh-6v49-42gf)),
  fixed in 1.82.1. The toolchain is pinned in six places that have to agree -
  `go.mod`, `integration/go.mod`, the `Dockerfile`, `build.sh` and `GO_VERSION`
  in both release workflows - and all six move together, or the image and a
  local build stop being the same build. `golang.org/x/crypto` goes
  to 0.55.0 with them; its fourth finding,
  [GO-2026-5932](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-5932), has no fixed version and
  needs none here - it is `x/crypto/openpgp` being unmaintained, and nothing in
  this tree imports it (`pbkdf2` and the `x509roots/fallback` registration are
  what it uses). Builds and vets clean, and the unit suites pass - all but
  `internal/backends/postgresql/metadata`, which wants a PostgreSQL on
  127.0.0.1:5432 and was not run rather than being run and failing by @xet7.
  Thanks to xet7.

- **A collection name that is not a string stays an error, and a BSON symbol
  still does not decode.** MongoDB's
  [CVE-2026-18690](https://hellorecon.com/blog/cve-2026-18690-mongodb-symbol-type-authz-bypass)
  is an authorization bypass built out of one line: `parseNsFromCommand` returned
  the DATABASE namespace when the first element of a command was not a `String`,
  so a name sent as a BSON **symbol** (tag `0x0E`, a string in everything but its
  tag) was authorized against the database while execution read the symbol
  anyway and opened the real collection. FerretDB is not affected, for three
  independent reasons - the wire decoder refuses tag `0x0E` outright
  (`unsupported tag Symbol`), `GetRequiredParam[string]` returns an error rather
  than falling back to a narrower namespace, and there is no per-namespace
  authorization phase here to disagree with execution. The first two are code,
  and code changes, so a test now pins them by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.50.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.50.0) (2026-08-12)

### Fixed 🐛

- **A leftover OpLog is no longer written to when no replica set is configured.**
  Whether a mutation gets copied into capped `local.oplog.rs`, and whether that
  collection may be created, were decided by two different questions, and after a
  reconfiguration they disagreed. The OpLog decorator asks only whether the
  collection EXISTS; `ensureOplog()` asks whether a replica-set name is set, and
  returns early without one — and `replSetInitiate` calls that same function, so
  a server started with no replica-set name can never create the collection
  itself. Start once WITH `--repl-set-name`, then take it away and restart, and
  every insert, update and delete went on being copied into the collection left
  behind, for as long as the deployment lived. Nothing could read those copies:
  with no replica-set name `hello` advertises no replica set, so a client's OpLog
  tailing cannot connect and falls back to poll-and-diff. It also cost a
  `ListCollections` on `local` per mutation, on top of the write. Reported on the
  SQLite backend: 3277 documents and 9 MiB of OpLog inside a 22 MiB `local.sqlite`,
  still growing by about ten documents a minute, with nothing tailing it. The two
  gates are now the same one — with no replica-set name the decorator is not
  installed at all, which also removes the per-mutation `ListCollections`.
  Stopping the writes is this server's decision to make; deleting somebody's
  collection is not, so an existing one is left on disk untouched and starts
  being used again as soon as a replica-set name is configured by @xet7.
  Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.49.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.49.0) (2026-08-10)

### New Features 🎉

- **An armv6 binary is built, with `GOARM=6`, for Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero.**
  `armel` is `GOARM=5` and WOULD run on an ARMv6 board, which is exactly why it
  looks like a substitute and is not one: `GOARM=5` does floating point in
  software, while these boards have VFPv2 and `GOARM=6` uses it. `armel` stays
  where it belongs, on genuine ARMv5. The release asset order lists `armv6`
  beside `armhf`, and `docker.yml` maps it to the `linux/arm/v6` platform — the
  OCI variant that matches, next to `armhf`'s `linux/arm/v7` and `armel`'s
  `linux/arm/v5`. This is the FerretDB half of an ARMv6 bundle for the client;
  the part that was actually missing there is Node.js, which nobody publishes
  for ARMv6 any more, so the client's own Node.js patch repository gained an
  armv6 target in the same pass by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- **The roadmap says what the build actually targets.** It claimed
  "cross-compile 9+ Linux arches without QEMU", which was true when it was
  written and is now
  both stale and vague. It lists the **seventeen** targets: ten Linux (`amd64`,
  `arm64`, `armhf` at `GOARM=7`, `armv6` at `GOARM=6`, `armel` at `GOARM=5`,
  `i386`, `ppc64le`, `s390x`, `riscv64`, `loong64`), three Windows, two macOS
  and two FreeBSD — and notes that the ten Linux ones are also the platforms of
  the `FROM scratch` multi-arch image, which is why that image reaches CPUs an
  image built on a Debian base cannot by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.48.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.48.0) (2026-08-09)

### Fixed 🐛

- **A top-level `$or` is pushed down to SQL when every branch can be.** Every
  top-level `$`-key was skipped when building the WHERE clause, so a selector
  whose only SELECTIVE terms sit inside an `$or` produced a clause that narrowed
  nothing: SQLite returned the rows and every one was decoded and filtered in Go
  to return a handful. That is the shape of the client's "which boards may this
  user see" query, and the worst possible one for it — `archived = false` and
  `type = 'board'` push down and match nearly everything, while the membership
  clauses that actually select stayed in Go. On an instance with ten thousand
  boards where a user belongs to five, that decoded ten thousand documents to
  return five, on every board-list load. It is **all or nothing**, and that is
  the whole subtlety: every other pushdown NARROWS, so a condition that cannot
  be expressed is dropped and the Go filter removes the extra rows — but an OR
  that drops a branch REMOVES rows that match it, and the Go filter never sees
  them, so the query silently returns fewer documents than match. One unpushable
  branch therefore refuses the whole `$or`, as does a branch carrying a nested
  operator (`$and`, another `$or`) and an empty branch, which would match
  everything anyway. When every branch pushes down, ORing them is still a
  superset, because each branch's SQL is a superset of that branch's matches.
  Tested both ways: a table test pins the clause and the four cases that must
  NOT push down, and `TestQueryOrPushdown` proves end-to-end that both branches'
  matches come back — if either were dropped it fails — and that a document
  matching neither is excluded by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.47.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.47.0) (2026-08-09)

### New Features 🎉

- **Operations the client never issues are marked, so the operator sees them
  tried.** This database is reached over a local socket by one application,
  whose driver is a Meteor 3 one. That makes a class of operations interesting
  by their mere presence: server-side JavaScript evaluation (`eval`, `$where`,
  `$function`, `$accumulator`, `mapReduce`), an aggregation writing its result
  into a collection (`$out`, `$merge`), dropping a database, and the commands
  that manage the server rather than the data (`shutdown`, `setParameter`,
  `logRotate`). The driver does not send any of them, so a request that does is
  either a bug or somebody who has reached the socket and is looking around, and
  both are worth telling the operator about. The new `internal/util/canary`
  refuses them with the ordinary *"operation not supported by this build"* — the
  same answer an unimplemented command gets — and appends `canary:<id>`, which
  the client reads off the error and records with the account and the address
  that sent it. Nothing in the message says anything was detected, so a probe
  cannot tell a watched operation from an unimplemented one and route around the
  watched ones; a test asserts the refusal contains none of *detect*, *record*,
  *log* or *alert*. The package **writes nothing** — no file, no table, no
  counter — so a caller hammering it in a loop costs one string comparison per
  request and this package no memory at all, which is what "FerretDB does not
  write to any database or file" means for canaries. Seven tests cover it,
  including that the ordinary vocabulary (`find`, `insert`, `aggregate`,
  `$match`, `$group`, `$lookup`) does NOT trip: a canary that fires on normal
  traffic is worse than no canary, because it buries the real ones by @xet7.
  Thanks to xet7.

- **The SQL guard's refusals reach the operator instead of a log file.** It
  already refused a statement carrying what only injection produces, and logged
  it at error level with a `SECURITY:` prefix — but a line in this process's log
  is not somewhere anybody looks, so an attack that reached a statement builder
  could go unnoticed for a month. Its error now carries the same
  `canary:db.sql-injection` marker, so the attempt is recorded where an operator
  will see it. A test pins that the marker the guard writes and the one the
  canary package parses are the same string; they are deliberately not shared in
  code, so that package keeps its standard-library-only shape by @xet7. Thanks
  to xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- **No source file names the application any more.** Five `.go` files carried
  it: the SQL guard's and `fsql`'s comments about where a refusal is surfaced,
  the SQLite pool's comment about a concurrent client, and two registry test
  comments about which indexes are declared. They say "the client" now. The two
  `wekan/wekan#6533` references became a bare `#6533`, and two test payloads
  that dropped a database by that name now drop `app`. This fork is a general
  MongoDB-compatible database; a reader of any file in it should not have to
  know which application prompted the change by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.46.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.46.0) (2026-08-08)

### Fixed 🐛

- **Cloning the repository works again without a Git LFS budget.** A plain
  `git clone git@github.com:wekan/FerretDB` transferred all 37315 objects and
  then failed its checkout — `Smudge error: ... This repository exceeded its LFS
  budget` — leaving a clone with no working tree unless the caller knew to set
  `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1`. The whole of that was ONE file: `.gitattributes` sent
  every `*.jpg`, `*.jpeg`, `*.png`, `*.webp` and `*.gif` through LFS, and the
  only image this fork carries is `docs/img/docs/aggregation-stages.jpg`, 150 KB
  of documentation picture that no build, test or WeKan use of the fork reads.
  Paying an LFS bill, and making every clone depend on that bill still being
  paid, to store 150 KB is the wrong trade for a fork that ships no docs site.
  The five patterns keep `-text`, so the images stay binary to Git and get no
  end-of-line conversion, but they no longer name a filter; the image itself is
  committed as an ordinary blob whose sha256 is the `0380eb1f...` oid the LFS
  pointer named, so the bytes are the same bytes. A clone now checks out with no
  LFS involvement at all by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- **Its test logs go where WeKan's do, wherever this clone is kept.** This repo
  is cloned inside a WeKan checkout so that "check the newest test logs" is one
  directory for everything, and `build.sh` got there with `$ROOT/../../log` -
  correct while the clone sat at `wekan/FerretDB`. WeKan keeps its companion
  repos in `wekan/.tools/` now, and from `wekan/.tools/FerretDB` that same
  string means `wekan/log`: one level short of the `../log/` every other test
  run writes to, so a standalone `./build.sh test-all` would have scattered its
  logs somewhere nothing looks. It walks up until it recognises a WeKan checkout
  - a `.meteor` directory beside a `build.sh` - and then applies WeKan's own
  rule: `../log` next to the checkout when that is writable, otherwise `log/`
  inside it, which is what a Flatpak sandbox sharing only the repository gets.
  Outside a checkout the logs stay with this repo, in `tmp/log`, and
  `WEKAN_LOGDIR` still wins over all of it so a run driven by WeKan shares that
  run's directory. Verified against five layouts with the resolution logic
  extracted: the new `.tools` path, the old one, a non-writable parent, a clone
  outside any checkout, and `WEKAN_LOGDIR` set by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **Git LFS cannot come back unnoticed.** The fix above is one `.gitattributes`
  line away from being undone, and the ways it comes back are all quiet: a merge
  from upstream, a `git lfs track`, an editor that runs `git lfs install` before
  pasting in an image. The commit that does it looks fine to its author and to
  CI — `actions/checkout` does not smudge LFS unless asked to, which is exactly
  why the release workflows kept building green while `git clone` was failing
  for everyone else — and the breakage surfaces in a stranger's clone days
  later. `.github/workflows/no-lfs.yml` runs `.github/scripts/no-lfs.sh` on
  every push and pull request, and it fails on three things: a tracked file that
  is an LFS pointer, a `.gitattributes` that routes a pattern through the lfs
  filter, and a committed `.lfsconfig`. The pointer check reads each tracked
  file's first line rather than running `git grep -I`, because a path whose
  `diff` attribute is unset counts as binary to grep and `-I` skips it — so the
  day someone writes the usual `*.png binary` macro, a grep-based guard stops
  looking at precisely the paths a pointer appears on. That is verified, not
  assumed: with `*.png binary` in place, `git grep -I` misses a pointer this
  check still finds. Only files of 1 KiB or less are opened, so the script and
  the workflow, which both quote the pointer's magic string, are not false
  positives by size rather than by an exception someone has to maintain. A
  commented-out `filter=lfs` line is inert and allowed; an untracked scratch
  file is not the repository's problem and is ignored. It runs locally too, as
  `./build.sh no-lfs` and as part of `./build.sh lint` and menu entry 8, by
  @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.45.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.45.0) (2026-08-04)

### Other Changes 🤖

- **A release can be completed without rebuilding it.** `release-all.yml`
  cross-compiles sixteen platforms one at a time — sequentially on purpose,
  because sixteen concurrent Go builds risk running the runner out of memory —
  and then uploads every binary with `--clobber`. When one platform was missing,
  an upload had failed, or a run was cancelled, the only way to get that one
  binary was to run the whole sequence again, replacing fifteen other platforms'
  bytes with identical bytes on the way. `release-all-missing.yml` beside it asks
  the release what it already carries and builds only the gap. It does not carry
  a second copy of the target list: it passes that list to the same
  `./build.sh dist-seq` the full release runs, as `FERRETDB_DIST_SKIP_LIST`, and
  `build.sh` skips those targets and reports them as `have`. A platform counts as
  present only when BOTH `ferretdb-<arch>[.exe]` and its `.sha256sum` are there,
  so a binary whose checksum upload failed is rebuilt rather than left half
  published; and because not every platform compiles, "missing" means "missing
  and buildable" — one that is absent and has no port is reported, not fatal.
  Nothing to build is a notice, not a failure. Verified against a seeded release
  with a stub compiler: of sixteen targets, two complete ones were kept, the one
  whose checksum was absent was rebuilt, the one that does not compile was
  reported, and the other thirteen were built by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.44.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.44.0) (2026-08-03)

### Other Changes 🤖

- **`go vet` reports something readable again.** The stage produced 8472 lines
  and 8449 of them were the same finding: the `composites` analyzer flagging
  `bson.E{"key", value}`, which is a composite literal of an imported struct
  set positionally — and is also the documented way to write a BSON element,
  which is why the tests are made of them. A real finding was invisible in
  that, and a stage nobody can read is a stage nobody reads. `-composites=false`
  turns off that one analyzer and leaves every other one on; the same run then
  reports 15 lines. Two of those were real and are also fixed: `./...` was
  walking `tmp/`, this script's own scratch — `GOTMPDIR` is `tmp/go` and a
  module cache had ended up under `tmp/gopath` — so vet was reporting on the Go
  toolchain's own sources and on a dependency's copy in the module cache.
  `tmp/` is filtered out of the package list now by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **A `.sha256sum` beside every released binary.** The release attached one
  `ferretdb-<arch>[.exe]` per platform and nothing to check a download against,
  so a consumer could not tell a truncated or tampered file from a good one —
  and WeKan's release build, which downloads these binaries into its bundles,
  verified its Node.js against a published checksum and had nothing to verify
  its database against. Every binary now gets a `ferretdb-<arch>.sha256sum` in
  the `<sum>  <file>` format `sha256sum -c` reads, one file per binary rather
  than one list for the release, because a consumer fetches only the platform it
  needs and should not have to pull a list covering fifteen others to check it.
  The release notes say so and show the three commands by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.43.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.43.0) (2026-07-28)

### New Features 🎉

- The `$group` accumulators that answered `"$avg" is not implemented yet` are implemented: **`$avg`, `$min`, `$max`, `$first`, `$last`, `$push`, `$addToSet`, `$stdDevPop` and `$stdDevSamp`** — only `$sum` and `$count` existed before, on every backend. A WeKan conformance run (the same query catalogue against every v1 backend) is what found them. `$avg` counts only numeric values and answers a double, or Null for a group with nothing numeric — not zero, which would claim an average that does not exist. `$min`/`$max` use MongoDB's total ordering of BSON types and skip documents where the expression resolves to nothing, rather than treating them as smaller than everything. `$first`/`$last` take the value in the first/last document as it arrives. `$push` skips documents where the expression resolves to nothing (the array is shorter, it does not gain a null) and `$addToSet` compares with the query language's own equality, so 1 and 1.0 are one value. The deviations use Welford's method in one pass, which keeps the small differences that (sum of squares − square of sum) loses, and `$stdDevSamp` of a single sample is Null because that is undefined, not zero by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

### Fixed 🐛

- **SQL injection through an index key, in the mysql backend.** A MongoDB index key is any field path the client likes, and it was spliced into two statements unescaped — `ADD COLUMN %s VARCHAR(255) GENERATED ALWAYS AS ((%s->'$.%s')) STORED` and `CREATE INDEX %s ON %s.%s (%s)` — so `createIndex({"a')) STORED, ADD COLUMN pwned VARCHAR(1) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (('x": 1})` wrote the client's own DDL. The **postgresql** backend already sanitised the same value, with a comment saying why; this one did not. It now goes through `metadata.SafeColumnName`, the replace-and-hash treatment table and index names get, so a hostile path can only become a column NAME, and the JSON path is a quoted literal. That closes a plain bug beside the hole: the index was built on `a.b`, a column that does not exist, so every dotted index key failed outright. Everywhere else was already safe — values are bound as parameters, database names are validated before any backend sees them, and collection and index names are sanitised where they are made by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- The guard above refused one legitimate statement, found by the first full test run: `collectionsStats` in the **sqlite** backend joined one ANALYZE per table into a single `ANALYZE "t1"; ANALYZE "t2";` string and executed that in one call — the only place in any backend that sent more than one statement at once, and a guard cannot tell that apart from an injected second statement, which is the whole point of refusing a `;`. 45 refusals, 11 failing integration tests (`collStats`, `dbStats`, `dataSize`, `$collStats`, `validate`, compact-capped). The statement changed rather than the rule: one ANALYZE per Exec, which keeps "one statement per call" absolute and costs one round trip per table on a stats refresh of a local file by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- Defence in depth for the next one: `internal/util/sqlguard` reads every finished statement in `fsql` — the one place all backends pass through — and REFUSES anything carrying a statement separator, a comment introducer, an unclosed quote or unbalanced parentheses outside a literal. Nothing FerretDB builds contains those; only injected data does. A refusal is logged at error level with a `SECURITY:` prefix and the statement, which is the only evidence such a thing happened (WeKan shows it in Admin Panel / Problems). The client's `$comment` is the one piece of text written into SQL rather than bound, so `sqlguard.SafeComment` neutralises every way out of the block — `*/`, `/*`, `--`, NUL, newlines — and bounds its length, replacing the ad-hoc `*/` replacement in two backends. Tested with the attacks themselves: hostile names checked property-wise, the guard against real statements as well as injected ones, and every escape from a comment block by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **MariaDB has no JSON type, MySQL's collStats asked for a column list that is not SQL, DeleteAll could never delete, DROP INDEX was PostgreSQL's, a boolean matched nothing, and a date range returned no rows.** The third run of the query catalogue against a live MySQL 9.7 and MariaDB 12.3 got MySQL to answer like SQLite on everything but two cases and got MariaDB running at last; reading the paths those fixes had just made reachable found the rest. `CAST(? AS JSON)` is a syntax error on MariaDB — JSON is an alias for LONGTEXT there — so `JSON_EXTRACT(?, '$')` is used instead, which parses the bound string on MySQL and returns it unchanged on MariaDB. `DeleteAll`'s branch was inverted AND crossed: the ordinary delete-by-`_id` sized its placeholders by `params.IDs`, filled its arguments from the nil `params.RecordIDs`, and pointed the `WHERE` at the record-id column, while the record-id path produced `WHERE  IN ()` — it could never delete a document either way. `DROP INDEX <schema>.<index>` is PostgreSQL; MySQL drops an index FROM A TABLE. The `JSON_CONTAINS` candidate is the value's own sjson text now, because MySQL has no boolean and a Go `true` bound directly is `1`, which does not match the stored JSON `true` — `{archived: false}` would have pushed a filter matching nothing, which is worse than an error, since a pushdown that is too NARROW is silently wrong and the in-Go filter never sees the rows. For the same reason date and BSON-timestamp RANGES are no longer pushed down here at all: `{when: {$gte: <date>}}` answered with no documents where every other backend answered with two, so the two temporal types are left to the Go filter until a live EXPLAIN shows the expression MySQL needs. And the per-index-size query behind `collStats` had a trailing comma before `FROM` and `t.table_name IN ?`, and read the TABLE's total index size as the size of every index; the sizes come from `mysql.innodb_index_stats` now, falling back to listing index names with an unknown size when that table is not readable by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **MariaDB could not create a collection, and MySQL still failed every equality, index creation and stats call.** A second conformance run against a live MySQL 9.7 and MariaDB 12.3 found four more, after the ones below took MySQL from 55 identical answers to 65 and from 44 errors to 33. `JSON_CONTAINS` wants a JSON DOCUMENT as its candidate and a bound parameter arrives as a string or a number, so `$eq`, `$ne` and `$in` all answered `Error 3146 (22032): Invalid data type for JSON data in argument 2 to function json_contains` — the candidate is `CAST(? AS JSON)` now. `createIndexes` on a field that already had an index answered `Error 1064`: the `ADD COLUMN` clauses were appended to one statement with the separating comma added BY POSITION, so a key whose generated column already existed left a trailing comma, and when every key was already extracted the statement was the bare `ALTER TABLE db.t`; the clauses are collected and joined, and the ALTER only runs when there is something to add. `collStats` and `dbStats` answered `Error 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 't.table_rows' in 'field list'`, because the statistics query wrote `t.*` without ever aliasing `information_schema.tables`, filtered on an `s.schema_name` that was never joined, and compared table names as IDENTIFIERS in an `IN` list where they are values. And MariaDB failed at the first insert with `Error 1064 ... near '>'$._id')) STORED'`: **MariaDB does not have MySQL's `->` and `->>` JSON operators**, so every place that used one — the `_id` expression, the metadata table's generated column, the OpLog `ts` index and the index generated columns — is `JSON_EXTRACT` / `JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(...))` now, which both engines understand by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- **SQLite answered `database is locked (5) (SQLITE_BUSY)` where the busy timeout could not help.** A WeKan instance with many concurrent users saw it out of `UpdateAll` under load, and a 30-second `busy_timeout` made no difference (wekan/wekan#6533). It could not: the driver's default is a DEFERRED transaction, which takes the write lock at its first WRITE, and if another connection has written since that transaction's read snapshot, SQLite fails it IMMEDIATELY and does NOT call the busy handler — waiting cannot refresh a snapshot that is already stale. The SQLite DSN now defaults to `_txlock=immediate`, so `BEGIN` itself asks for the write lock, which the busy handler DOES cover, and a contended writer waits its turn instead of failing. Only the two write paths (`InsertAll`, `UpdateAll`) open a transaction in this backend — reads are plain queries — so nothing is held back from readers under WAL, and an operator-supplied `_txlock` still wins by @xet7. Thanks to Nissulya and xet7.

- The **mysql** backend answered every FILTERED query with `Error 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax`, and MariaDB could not open a database whose metadata table already existed. With the two blockers below fixed, a conformance run reached the backend for the first time and 44 of its 100 cases failed the same way: every pushed-down filter was built as `col->$.?`, which is not MySQL — the `->` operator takes a LITERAL JSON path, and a placeholder there is a syntax error — so any find, update or aggregation carrying a filter failed outright ($eq, $ne, $in, every range bound). The unit tests pinned the same broken string, so they passed while nothing worked. The path is bound through `JSON_EXTRACT(col, ?)` now, built as a QUOTED path member so that `$."a.b"` is the field literally named `a.b` and a quote or backslash inside a name cannot end the member early; the `$ne` type check compared against `col->'$.$s.p.?.t'`, where the `?` sits inside a string literal and was never a placeholder at all, and is `JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(col, ?)) = ?` with the type name bound. MariaDB then failed at its first insert with `Error 1050 (42S01): Table '_ferretdb_database_metadata' already exists`: `databaseGetOrCreate` created that table unconditionally, while the registry's view of which schemas are FerretDB databases is built once, at startup — so a database created by an earlier process, or one that startup scan missed, reached that path with everything already in place and every insert into it failed for as long as the process ran. It checks for the table and ADOPTS it now, reading the collections out of it by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- The **mysql** backend could not store anything at all, on either MySQL or MariaDB. A WeKan conformance run against a real MySQL 9.7 and MariaDB 12.3 found both. MySQL rejected every statement with `Error 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax ... near '"conformance"."conformance_7d687332" (_ferretdb_sjson) VALUES (?)'`: the statements were built with Go's `%q` verb, correct in the PostgreSQL backend this code was modelled on and wrong here, because MySQL quotes identifiers with BACKTICKS and double quotes are string literals unless the session runs in `ANSI_QUOTES`. A `quoteIdent` helper now does it properly — an inner backtick doubled, as MySQL requires — and the five INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE statements use it; the unit test that pinned the broken form now pins the working one, and the helper has its own. MariaDB failed earlier still, with `this user requires mysql native password authentication`: `parseURI` built a `mysql.Config` LITERAL, whose zero value has `AllowNativePasswords` false, so the driver refused any server asking for that handshake — which is every MariaDB with a default root account, while MySQL happened to work because it defaults to `caching_sha2_password`. It uses `mysql.NewConfig()` now, so the driver's documented defaults hold by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- `./build.sh build` produced a binary that could not start: `panic: commit.txt value "..." != vcs.revision value "..."`. Go stamps the VCS revision into the binary, and `build/version/version.go` panics in `init()` when it disagrees with the committed `build/version/commit.txt` — and those files are only refreshed by the generator, so EVERY commit made after the last refresh built a binary that panicked, whatever the change was. `act_dist` already regenerated them before cross-compiling, which is why the released binaries are fine and only the local build was broken; `act_build` does the same now by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- Documentation caught up with the four changes above. `ROADMAP.md`: the fork-work section gained the `$group` accumulators, the injection fix and its statement guard, and the two bugs that stopped the **mysql** backend from storing anything; the parity table gained rows for the accumulators, for identifiers never carrying client data and for the guard; the aggregation matrix gained a row naming every accumulator and what is still missing (`$mergeObjects`, `$accumulator`, `$top`/`$bottom`, the `$*N` family). The compatibility matrix said MySQL "implements the full `Collection` interface", which was true and useless while it could not execute a single statement — it now says what changed, that **MariaDB runs on that same backend**, and that SAP HANA needs the `ferretdb_hana` build tag the releases carry. The verification boundary gained the other side of the evidence: WeKan's conformance harness runs one catalogue of 100 cases against every backend with an image for the machine, and **98 of 100 answered identically** on a live SQLite and a live PostgreSQL — not the integration suite, no `EXPLAIN`, but a real client against a real engine, and what found the missing accumulators and both MySQL/MariaDB blockers. `docs/main.md` no longer says only "MySQL and SAP HANA remain partial", and `README.md` documents the other three backends: the commands, the CREATE DATABASE right MySQL needs, the hana build tag, and WeKan's compose file for each by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- The released binaries now carry the **hana** handler. It sits behind the `ferretdb_hana` build tag, and neither the per-arch release build nor the local `build.sh` build passed that tag — so every published `ferretdb-<arch>` answered `--handler=hana` with "unknown handler", and a SAP HANA deployment could only be had by building FerretDB from source with the tag. Both builds pass `-tags ferretdb_hana` now; `go-hdb` is pure Go, so it cross-compiles under `CGO_ENABLED=0` like the rest and no target loses its binary. This is what lets wekan/wekan ship a `docker-compose-ferretdb-v1-sap-hana.yml` that downloads a release binary. The backend itself is unchanged and still experimental by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.42.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.42.0) (2026-07-24)

### Fixed 🐛

- MariaDB support for the OpLog `ts` index in the **mysql** backend. The index was created with a MySQL 8.0.13 *functional key part* `CREATE INDEX ... ((CAST(_ferretdb_sjson->>'$.ts' AS DECIMAL(65,10))))`, which MariaDB does not support (no functional key parts) — so on MariaDB the `CREATE INDEX` parse-errored and the idle OpLog tail lost its index acceleration (best-effort, so collection creation still succeeded). `collectionCreate` now falls back, when the functional index fails, to the same generated-`STORED`-column workaround the regular indexes already use: it adds a `DECIMAL(65,10) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CAST(...)) STORED` column and indexes that column, which MariaDB accepts, so the ts index EXISTS on both MySQL and MariaDB. Still best-effort and non-fatal (a failure of every form is logged with the exact SQL + error and the tail falls back to a sequential scan). Whether the optimizer actually USES the index for the `{ts:{$gt}}` tail — the pushdown expression must match the indexed expression — still needs `EXPLAIN` on a live MySQL and MariaDB by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- Documentation: this fork's Docker images are now documented where people look for them, and both v1 backends are stated as working. `README.md` gained a "This fork's Docker images" section listing the three registries `.github/workflows/docker.yml` actually pushes to — Docker Hub `wekanteam/ferretdb`, Quay.io `quay.io/wekan/ferretdb` and GHCR `ghcr.io/wekan/ferretdb` — with browse links, a note that each push is independent so one registry being down does not block the others, what the `FROM scratch` `Dockerfile.release` image defaults to (SQLite handler, `/state`, telemetry disabled) and a `FERRETDB_HANDLER=postgresql` run command; the upstream all-in-one quickstart is kept and relabelled as upstream's. `docs/quickstart-guide/docker.md` gained the same fork-image section above the upstream images. `docs/main.md` and `ROADMAP.md` no longer describe the vanilla **postgresql** backend as untested: both the embedded **sqlite** backend (the CI target here) and vanilla **PostgreSQL** are confirmed working with a real Meteor 3 client (wekan/wekan#6509), so the compatibility matrix, the storage-backends note and the matrix preamble say confirmed-working instead of untested, while still stating that CI here runs SQLite and that this fork's new index options (text `weights`/`default_language`, `hidden`, `collation`, `partialFilterExpression`, `2dsphere`) are round-tripped only by the sqlite backend, and that MySQL and SAP HANA remain partial/experimental by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- MariaDB vs the `mysql` backend — assessment (see `ROADMAP.md`). MariaDB speaks the MySQL wire protocol and the backend does not gate on vendor/version, so the `mysql` backend runs against MariaDB through the same driver; every MariaDB-sensitive statement was reviewed: the `json` column, `->`/`->>`/`JSON_CONTAINS`/`JSON_TYPE`, the `GENERATED ... STORED` index workaround, `EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON` (parsed by a generic JSON→Document converter, so MariaDB's different plan JSON is tolerated) and the `information_schema` queries all work on MariaDB 10.2+. The one concrete break — the functional OpLog ts index — is fixed above. Every pushdown is a superset with an exact in-Go re-filter, so results stay correct on MariaDB regardless of index choice or `JSON_TYPE` token differences; the remaining work is the same live-`EXPLAIN` index-usage verification as MySQL, not vendor-specific query rewrites by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- Release automation: removed the misleading "gh token is missing the 'workflow' scope — dispatch will 403" pre-check from `build.sh` `trigger_workflow`. It fired a false warning during the v1.41.0 release even though the dispatch then succeeded: `gh auth status` does not report the dispatch capability for a fine-grained PAT or a GitHub App token (both dispatch fine without the classic `workflow` scope), so pre-judging the scope is unreliable. The fatal "gh is not authenticated" preflight stays, and a real permission error is now explained only when the dispatch actually fails — the final error message covers both a classic PAT (needs the `workflow` scope, `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s workflow`) and a fine-grained PAT / app token (needs Actions: write) by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.41.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.41.0) (2026-07-23)

### Other Changes 🤖

- Release automation: `build.sh` now dispatches the release workflow reliably instead of leaving you to click "Run workflow" in the Actions tab. `trigger_workflow` (used by `./build.sh release-ferretdb` and option 13) now resolves `OWNER/REPO` from the git remote and pins it with `gh workflow run -R`, so `gh` targets the right repo even when the repo is not auto-detected; runs an auth + scope preflight (`gh auth status`) that fails fast if `gh` is not authenticated and warns, with the exact `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s workflow` fix, when the token is missing the `workflow` scope (the usual silent 403 cause); retries the dispatch five times to ride out the few-second delay before GitHub registers a just-pushed new workflow; and falls back to the REST dispatch API (`gh api .../actions/workflows/<wf>/dispatches`) when the direct `gh workflow run` still does not take. The three FerretDB workflows already declare `on: workflow_dispatch` on the default branch, so the remaining requirement is only that `gh` is authenticated with the `workflow` scope by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.40.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.40.0) (2026-07-23)

### Fixed 🐛

- Pushdown parity across backends: the **postgresql**, **mysql** and **hana** backends now push down numeric / date / BSON-Timestamp range filters (`$gt`/`$gte`/`$lt`/`$lte`), matching the **sqlite** backend. Previously all three dropped every range operator from the WHERE, so an idle OpLog tail's `{ts: {$gt: <last>}}` — and any range query — scanned the whole (capped) collection and range-filtered in Go on every awaitData poll (constant idle CPU). sjson stores int/double, a Date (as its Unix-millis) and a Timestamp (as its uint64) all as JSON numbers, so the bound pushes down as: postgresql `jsonb_typeof(_jsonb->'field') = 'number' AND (_jsonb->>'field')::numeric <op> $n` (the `jsonb_typeof` guard is required — PG's `::numeric` throws on a non-number); mysql `JSON_TYPE(_ferretdb_sjson->$.?) IN ('INTEGER','DOUBLE','DECIMAL') AND _ferretdb_sjson->$.? <op> ?`; hana `"field" <op> <number>` via `makeFilter` (best-effort DocStore comparison). All keep the pushed filter a SUPERSET — only number-typed docs are pre-filtered — and the in-Go filter re-applies the exact, type-bracketed comparison; a Timestamp above int64 is declined. Unit-tested in each backend's `query_test.go` (`RangeTimestampGt` / `RangeNumberLte` / `RangeStringBoundNotPushed`). Correctness and index usage on live PostgreSQL / MySQL / MariaDB / SAP HANA remain to be verified with the integration suite (this is the first step of bringing those backends to full Meteor parity with sqlite) by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- Pushdown parity, `$in`: the **postgresql**, **mysql** and **hana** backends now push down `{field: {$in: [...]}}`, matching the **sqlite** backend. It renders as an OR of per-element arms — one equality/containment arm per pushable element (postgresql `_jsonb->'field' @> $n`, mysql `JSON_CONTAINS(_ferretdb_sjson->$.?, ?, '$')`, hana `"field" = <value>`) plus, for a `null` element, a `field IS NULL OR field == null` arm that matches a missing-or-null field. Previously all three dropped `$in` from the WHERE, so a client filter like `{field: {$in: [id, null]}}` full-scanned the whole collection and filtered in Go on every poll. The pushed filter stays a SUPERSET — only safe elements are pushed and the whole `$in` is declined when any element is a nested doc/array/binary/regex/Timestamp — and the in-Go filter re-applies the exact `$in` in all cases. Unit-tested in each backend's `query_test.go` (`InPushed` / `InWithNullPushed`). Index usage on live PostgreSQL / MySQL / SAP HANA remains to be verified with the integration suite by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- Pushdown: a DOTTED-path field equality / `$in` (e.g. `{'meta.cardId': X}`) now pushes down as the nested `->` expression `col->"meta"->"cardId"` — which matches the nested expression index the registry already builds for a dotted index key — instead of being dropped from the WHERE. Previously `prepareWhereClause` skipped any key containing a `.`, so a client's dotted lookup (e.g. a Meteor-Files attachment find `{'meta.cardId': X}` when a card is opened) emitted no WHERE and full-scanned the whole collection with a per-row sjson decode on every poll — turning a small card into a ~40s open and keeping an idle poll-and-diff session's CPU high. Only scalar string/ObjectID equality and `$in` are pushed for a dotted path (their SQL references only the nested expression); ranges and `$regex` on a dotted path stay in the Go filter, and the Go filter remains authoritative in all cases (`internal/backends/sqlite/query.go`). Covered by `internal/backends/sqlite/query_test.go` (`DottedPathEqualityPushed` / `DottedPathInPushed` / `DottedPathRangeNotPushed`) and `internal/backends/sqlite/metadata/registry_test.go` (`TestDottedPathEqualityUsesIndex`, which asserts via `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` that the nested index is used and there is no SCAN) by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- OpLog `ts` index on the **postgresql**, **mysql** and **hana** backends, mirroring the
  **sqlite** backend: when the capped `local.oplog.rs` collection is created, a matching
  index on the `ts` value is created so an idle tail's `{ts: {$gt: <last>}}` cursor can
  resume with an index range scan instead of re-scanning the whole capped collection on
  every awaitData poll. postgresql builds a btree expression index
  `CREATE INDEX … (((_jsonb->>'ts')::numeric))` — the same expression the range pushdown
  emits, so it is actually used; mysql builds a functional index
  `((CAST(_ferretdb_sjson->>'$.ts' AS DECIMAL(65,10))))` (a JSON expression cannot be
  indexed directly), which needs a live `EXPLAIN` to confirm the pushdown expression
  matches it; hana attempts a DocStore index on `ts`, but its indexes are HASH (equality),
  so range acceleration must be confirmed on a live engine. Every index is created
  BEST-EFFORT and non-fatally: a failed `CREATE INDEX` is logged with the exact SQL and
  error (so a wrong syntax on a live engine is visible) and the tail simply falls back to a
  sequential scan — it never blocks collection creation. Index USABILITY on live
  PostgreSQL / MySQL / SAP HANA still needs `EXPLAIN` verification with the integration
  suite by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- Docs: `ROADMAP.md` and `docs/pushdown.md` now describe the multi-backend Meteor-parity work — the range / `$in` pushdown now supported on the postgresql, mysql and hana backends (not only sqlite), the status matrix, and the live-`EXPLAIN` verification boundary that remains by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.39.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.39.0) (2026-07-22)

### Fixed 🐛

- Pushdown: a `$in` filter that mixes pushdown-safe strings with a `null` now pushes down its safe subset instead of bailing out entirely. `{field: {$in: [id, null]}}` becomes `(expr IN (?) OR expr IS NULL OR <array-arm>)` — all three arms reference the field's expression index, so SQLite serves it as an OR-union of index lookups. A `null` `$in` element also matches a missing field, and both render as SQL NULL under `->`, so `expr IS NULL` is an exact, index-usable superset arm; the in-Go filter stays the authority. Previously the first non-string element (the `null`) made `inCondition` bail, so the whole WHERE was dropped and the entire collection was full-scanned and sjson-decoded on every poll — which, for a poll-and-diff client (e.g. a Meteor 3 driver) issuing `{boardId: {$in: [boardId, null]}}` card queries on a big board, meant the board's lists loaded but its cards never did (`internal/backends/sqlite/query.go`). Numbers, bools, unsafe strings and nested docs/arrays still leave the whole `$in` to the Go filter. Covered by `internal/backends/sqlite/query_test.go` (`InWithNullPushed` / `InOnlyNullPushed` / `InIdWithNullPushed` / `InNumberElementNotPushed`) and `internal/backends/sqlite/metadata/registry_test.go` (`TestInWithNullUsesIndex`, which asserts via `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` that the planner uses the index and does not SCAN) by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.38.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.38.0) (2026-07-22)

### Fixed 🐛

- OpLog tail: push down and index the `{ts: {$gt: <last>}}` cursor filter, so an idle tail is an index range scan instead of decoding and scanning the whole capped collection on every awaitData poll. A BSON `Timestamp` is stored as its uint64 (a JSON number), so a `$gt`/`$gte` bound now pushes down as a numeric `->>` comparison (`internal/backends/sqlite/query.go`); previously `ts` was left entirely to the in-Go filter, so each awaitData poll re-decoded every document's sjson in Go — a residual CPU load that could peg the FerretDB process (300%+) while the client sat idle. The capped `local.oplog.rs` also gets a matching expression index on its Timestamp value (`internal/backends/sqlite/metadata/registry.go`), and `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` confirms the planner uses it for the tail range. This mainly helps a client that tails a capped collection with a `{ts: {$gt}}` cursor (e.g. a Meteor 3 driver tailing the OpLog) — wekan/wekan#6480. Covered by `internal/backends/sqlite/query_test.go` (`RangeTimestampPushed` / `RangeTimestampOverflowNotPushed`) and `internal/backends/sqlite/metadata/registry_test.go` (`TestOplogTsIndexUsedForTailRange`) by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- Release automation: releasing is now one command that runs the whole chain. `build.sh` "Release FerretDB" (option 15 / `./build.sh release-ferretdb`) renames the `## Upcoming FerretDB release` heading to the next version (with the correct git-tag link), commits, tags `vX.Y.Z` and pushes, then triggers "Release via GitHub Actions" (`release-all.yml`, which builds every per-arch binary and publishes the GitHub Release), and `release-all.yml` in turn dispatches "Docker via GitHub Actions" (`docker.yml`, which builds and pushes the multi-arch image to Docker Hub, Quay.io and GHCR — no recompilation). `docker.yml` already listened for a published release, but a release created with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not emit that event, so `release-all.yml` now dispatches it explicitly (via `workflow_dispatch`, passing the release version, plus the `actions: write` permission it needs) by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.37.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.37.0) (2026-07-21)

### Fixed 🐛

- OpLog: keep tailable cursors OPEN on an empty first batch, so an idle tail is resumed with `getMore` instead of re-issuing `find` every ~100ms (wekan/wekan#6480). A tailable/awaitData `find` whose first batch was under-full — which for an idle tail is always (0 documents) — closed the cursor and returned `id: 0`, so a client tailing an otherwise-idle capped collection (e.g. a Meteor 3 driver tailing `local.oplog.rs`) had to re-issue `find` continuously, each time re-scanning the collection — a residual constant CPU load even after the v1.36.0 awaitData poll fix. Now only a Normal cursor (or an explicit `singleBatch`) is exhausted there; a tailable cursor stays registered with its non-zero id so the client resumes with `getMore`. This required fixing `Cursor.Reset` for the not-yet-consumed case (`lastRecordID == 0`, the empty-first-batch tail), which previously scanned the new iterator for record id 0, never found it, exhausted the iterator and errored — the very reason an empty tailable cursor could not be kept open before; it now iterates from the beginning in that case. Covered by `internal/clientconn/cursor/cursor_test.go` (`TestCursor/Tailable/ResetFromEmpty`) and a real-backend integration test `internal/handler/msg_find_test.go` (`TestFindTailableKeepsCursorOpenOnEmptyCapped`: a tailable find on an empty capped collection returns a non-zero cursor id, while a normal find is still exhausted) by @xet7. Thanks to bluetopaz1204, mueschel, crochu and xet7.

## [v1.36.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.36.0) (2026-07-21)

### Fixed 🐛

- OpLog: stop `awaitData` busy-polling the tailed capped collection, which pinned FerretDB CPU (~140%) even with no clients connected (wekan/wekan#6498). A tailable+awaitData `getMore` with no new data re-ran the cursor's query every 10ms until its `maxTimeMS` budget elapsed. This backend has no server-side "new data" signal for a capped tailable cursor (unlike a real capped collection), so `awaitData` polls by re-running the query — at 10ms that is ~100 full scans/second. A client that keeps such a cursor open continuously with no other activity — e.g. a Meteor 3 driver tailing the capped operations log `local.oplog.rs` — therefore drove continuous high CPU even with no application clients and nothing else happening (this is a distinct cause from the OpLog bloat capped in v1.35.0: it is the tail's poll rate, not the OpLog size). `maxTimeMS` already defaults to 1000ms, so the await window was fine; only the poll interval was too aggressive. It now polls at a calmer 500ms by default (still well within the 1s await budget, so new-data latency stays low), bounded by the remaining `maxTimeMS` via `ctxutil.Sleep`, and tunable with `FERRETDB_TAILABLE_AWAIT_POLL_MS` (0/invalid falls back to the default, never a busy-loop) — cutting idle tail query load ~50x. New `tailableAwaitPollInterval` in `internal/handler/msg_getmore.go`, covered by `internal/handler/msg_getmore_test.go`: `TestTailableAwaitPollInterval` (default is calm and not the old 10ms; honours a custom value; and the negatives zero/negative/non-numeric/empty all fall back to the default and never to a busy-loop) by @xet7. Thanks to Alishara, bluetopaz1204, mueschel and xet7.

## [v1.35.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.35.0) (2026-07-21)

### New Features 🎉

- SQLite backend: automatic corruption detection and bloat repair when a database file is opened (wekan/wekan#6492). Two non-destructive safety measures run for every persistent (non in-memory) SQLite database as it is opened, so a file can neither silently hide corruption nor keep growing: (1) a fast read-only `PRAGMA quick_check` DETECTS corruption and, when it reports anything but `ok`, logs it prominently at ERROR level naming the database — corruption cannot be repaired in place, so this reports it for the operator/client to recover (restore from a backup copy or re-migrate the text data; filesystem attachments are untouched); and (2) automatic BLOAT REPAIR — the file's `page_count`/`freelist_count` are checked and, when the file is at least ~1 MiB and a quarter or more of its pages are free, FerretDB `VACUUM`s it to rebuild the file compactly and return the free space (a churny collection such as the tailed `local.oplog.rs` leaves free pages that keep the file large and CPU high). Both are best-effort (any failure is logged, never blocks opening the database) and can be turned off with `FERRETDB_SQLITE_AUTO_REPAIR=false`. New `checkAndRepairSQLite`/`sqliteQuickCheck`/`sqliteBloated` in `internal/backends/sqlite/metadata/pool/opendb.go`, documented in `docs/reference/safety-and-recovery.md`, covered by `internal/backends/sqlite/metadata/pool/opendb_test.go`: `TestSqliteQuickCheckHealthy`, `TestSqliteBloatedAndVacuum` (a file with a large freelist is detected as bloated and VACUUM reclaims it), and the negatives `TestSqliteBloatedNegativeSmallDB` (a tiny database is never churned) and `TestCheckAndRepairSQLiteNoopWhenDisabledOrMemory` (skipped for in-memory databases and when disabled) by @xet7. Thanks to bluetopaz1204, mueschel and xet7.

### Fixed 🐛

- OpLog: cap `local.oplog.rs` much smaller (16 MiB, was 128 MiB) so the SQLite OpLog cannot bloat and drive high FerretDB CPU (wekan/wekan#6492). Meteor tails `local.oplog.rs` constantly, and on the SQLite backend every tail scans the collection's live rows while writers hold SQLite's file-level lock; a 128 MiB OpLog kept `local.sqlite` large and made those scans and lock holds expensive, so FerretDB CPU pegged at 300%+ even when idle (users confirmed that deleting `local.sqlite*` dropped CPU straight back to ~10%). Only a small sliding window of the most recent mutations is needed for tailing — a client that falls behind the window simply falls back to poll-and-diff, with no data loss — so `oplogCappedSizeBytes` (`internal/handler/handler.go`) is reduced to 16 MiB, keeping `local.sqlite` tiny and the tail cheap; the existing capped-collection cleanup (every minute) trims older entries down to this size. Covered by `internal/handler/msg_replset_test.go`: `TestOplogCappedSizeBounded` (positive: a real positive cap that is genuinely capped; negatives: below the old 128 MiB and never 0/unbounded), an integration test `TestEnsureOplogCreatesCappedOplog` that opens a real SQLite backend and asserts `ensureOplog` creates `local.oplog.rs` capped at exactly `oplogCappedSizeBytes`, and a negative `TestEnsureOplogNoopWithBackendButNoReplSet` (no replica-set name → no OpLog created) by @xet7. Thanks to bluetopaz1204, mueschel and xet7.

## [v1.34.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.34.0) (2026-07-20)

### New Features 🎉

- Self-throttle command + autonomous CPU self-regulation (host-CPU governor). A client that shares the host with FerretDB (and cannot pause FerretDB's internal work from the outside) can call the custom `throttle` command to learn how busy FerretDB is and to ask it to slow down when the host CPU is high. The command returns `commandsProcessed` (a running count) and `operationsSummary` (the busiest commands, e.g. `find=12000, update=340, …` — what FerretDB has been doing), and enables a **self-expiring throttle**: while active, every command pauses `slowDownMs` (clamped `[0,1000]`, default 5) before it runs, for `durationMs` (clamped `[0,300000]`, default 2000). Because a client may itself be too CPU-starved to measure the load or send the request, **FerretDB also self-regulates on its own** (`internal/handler/selfregulate.go`): a background loop samples the host CPU from `/proc/stat` and, when it is too high, adds its own increasing delay before each command until CPU drops below a target, then backs off. The delay applied per command is `max(client slowDownMs, self-regulated delay)`; the response also reports `autoSlowDownMs` and `hostCpuPercent`. Applied in the command dispatch path (`internal/handler/commands.go`), skipping the throttle command and the cheap health/handshake commands (`hello`/`ismaster`/`ping`); the client throttle self-expires (max 5 min) so a crashed client can never leave FerretDB permanently slow. Self-regulation is tunable via `FERRETDB_CPU_*` env vars (default on; a no-op where `/proc/stat` is unreadable). New files `internal/handler/throttle.go`, `internal/handler/msg_throttle.go`, `internal/handler/selfregulate.go`; covered by `internal/handler/throttle_test.go` and `internal/handler/selfregulate_test.go` (throttle set/clamp/expiry, per-command counting + summary, effective-delay = max(client, self-regulated), the escalate/hold/back-off decision, and `/proc/stat` parsing) by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- Report FerretDB's own process CPU% in the `throttle` response (wekan/wekan#6480). Both the `throttle` command and the autonomous self-regulation loop measured only the **host-wide** CPU from `/proc/stat`, which hides the exact problem users reported: on a many-core host FerretDB can peg 2–3 cores (a `processCpuPercent` of 200–300) while the host-wide percentage stays moderate (e.g. 3 of 4 cores busy = 75%), so nothing ever crossed a host-wide threshold and the client's "Problems / CPU usage" panel showed nothing. The self-regulation loop now also samples FerretDB's own process CPU from `/proc/self/stat` (`utime`+`stime`, read from after the last `)` so a process name with spaces/parens parses correctly) and normalises it against the same host-jiffies delta and core count, so `processCpuPercent` is `100 == one full core` and may exceed 100 across cores. It is added to the `throttle` command response next to `hostCpuPercent`, letting a client attribute and surface high CPU to FerretDB regardless of core count. Covered by a new `TestProcSelfCPU` (monotonic process-jiffies read; safe no-op where `/proc/self/stat` is unreadable) and the updated `throttleStatus` tests by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- De-brand the source code: FerretDB v1 (SQLite) is a general-purpose MongoDB 7 replacement usable by any MongoDB-wire client (e.g. Meteor 3 based software), not one specific application. Removed every "wekan" name from all `.go` files — the custom throttle command and its identifiers were renamed to the general `throttle` (`MsgThrottle`, `throttle{Set,Active,Apply,Status}`, files `throttle*.go`), and fork comments across the SQLite backend, handler, types and their tests were reworded to describe the general scenario (a Meteor 3 poll-and-diff workload, a MongoDB → FerretDB migration, the hottest `{field: value}` query, …). The fork's real distribution identity (repo URL, image names) is unchanged by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Documentation: reconcile the `supported-commands` API reference with the fork's true state — verified operator-by-operator against the source of truth (`internal/handler/common/aggregations` `Operators`/`unsupportedOperators`/`Stages`/`unsupportedStages`/`Accumulators` maps and `internal/handler/commands.go`). Marked the fork-added aggregation operators/stages and the `replSetInitiate`/`replSetGetStatus`/`replSetGetConfig`/`currentOp` commands supported, downgraded registered compat-no-op session/transaction commands to ⚠️, and documented the `throttle` extension command by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Documentation: convert the docs website from Docusaurus to a self-contained **static site** so it can be published as-is by GitHub Pages (no Docusaurus/Node/build server). The docs stay as plain Markdown in `docs/` and a small dependency-free generator (`docs/build.py`) renders one `.html` next to each `.md`, plus `index.html`, `style.css`, a navigation sidebar and `.nojekyll`. Removed the old `website/` (Docusaurus config, `src`, `static`, `blog`, `versioned_docs`, the render container) and repointed the `docs`/`docs-dev` Task targets, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, ignore files, `CODEOWNERS` and the release checklist at the new `docs/`. No rendered HTML is committed: the docs stay as Markdown and are rendered on demand — `python3 docs/build.py --serve` previews the site locally in memory (writes nothing), and `.github/workflows/pages.yml` renders and deploys it to GitHub Pages at push time (Settings -> Pages -> Source: GitHub Actions) so the HTML only ever exists in the deployed artifact by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.33.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.33.0) (2026-07-19)

### New Features 🎉

- OpLog: make "run with an OpLog" the out-of-the-box behaviour so Meteor/WeKan can tail changes instead of poll-and-diff (wekan/wekan#6480, wekan/wekan#6481). With FerretDB there is no MongoDB replica-set OpLog, so Meteor observed every live query by re-running it on a timer, which pinned FerretDB above 100–390% CPU on busy boards. FerretDB v1 already wrote correctly-shaped `local.oplog.rs` entries and served tailable/`awaitData` cursors, but the OpLog was opt-in and manual (the capped collection had to be created by hand) and the replica-set handshake was incomplete, so WeKan defaulted to polling. This release closes the gap: (1) `ensureOplog` (`internal/handler/handler.go`) auto-creates the capped `local.oplog.rs` (128 MiB) at startup — and on `replSetInitiate` — whenever a replica-set name is configured (`FERRETDB_REPL_SET_NAME`), best-effort so a failure never blocks startup; (2) `hello`/`isMaster` now advertise the full single-node-primary identity (`me`, `primary`, `secondary:false`, `setVersion`) in addition to `setName`/`hosts`, which the MongoDB drivers' topology monitor (SDAM) requires before it will accept the server as the replica-set PRIMARY and open the OpLog connection; and (3) new `replSetGetStatus` and `replSetGetConfig` commands return a valid single-member status/config for `rs.status()`/`rs.conf()` and driver/tooling probes. FerretDB v1 presents a single-node, always-primary replica set of one — no real multi-node replication or election. Covered by `internal/handler/msg_replset_test.go` (positive + negative: hello RS fields present only when a set is configured, host normalisation, `replSetGetStatus`/`replSetGetConfig` primary docs, the not-a-replica-set error, and `ensureOplog` as a no-op without a set name) by @xet7. Thanks to uusijani, Nissulya and xet7.

### Fixed 🐛

- SQLite backend: cut FerretDB CPU and latency under WeKan by tuning the SQLite connection pragmas (wekan/wekan#6480). Users reported FerretDB sitting above 100% CPU with everything after the login screen extremely slow even on WeKan v10.02, after the earlier `busy_timeout`, filter-pushdown and connection-pool fixes. `setDefaultValues` (`internal/backends/sqlite/metadata/pool/uri.go`) now also applies these connection pragmas — as DEFAULTS, so an operator-supplied `_pragma` of the same name still wins: `synchronous(normal)`, which is crash-safe under WAL (no corruption; at worst the last committed transaction is lost on power loss) and removes an fsync per commit, the single biggest write-path win; `cache_size(-65536)` (64 MiB page cache per connection) and `mmap_size(268435456)` (256 MiB memory-mapped I/O), which keep WeKan's hot pages resident in RAM so the repeated reads Meteor's poll-and-diff issues stop hitting the disk and burning CPU (and shorten lock holds, reducing SQLITE_BUSY); and `temp_store(memory)` so sorts and temporary indexes stay in RAM. The `parseURI` table tests (`uri_test.go`, refactored around a shared `defaultPragmas` constant) and `TestDefaults` (`pool_test.go`) assert the applied `PRAGMA` values against a real database, and a new `TestSetDefaultValues` adds negative tests proving an operator-supplied pragma is never duplicated by a default by @xet7. Thanks to uusijani and xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- Documentation: expanded `ROADMAP.md` from a v1-vs-v2 compatibility matrix into a full reference for running WeKan on this fork. Added, in order: an introduction to what the fork does; where FerretDB info is visible inside WeKan (Admin Panel → Info Version-page rows — FerretDB version/commit, storage engine, Oplog enabled, Reactivity mode/order, DDP transport — plus Admin Panel → Problems → Speed/Tests and the `slow query` WARN in the server log); the complete `ferretdb` CLI options and their `FERRETDB_*` env vars; the SQLite pragma defaults and fork-specific settings; the full list of features and fixes added AFTER xet7 forked from upstream v1.24.2 (OpLog/replica-set handshake, SQLite pragmas + pool sizing + filter pushdown, slow-query logging, crash/migration robustness, aggregation/operator build-out, index options, session/transaction commands, telemetry lockdown, release tooling); and what upstream FerretDB v1.24.2 already provided before the fork. The existing compatibility matrix is kept as the detailed reference by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Log slow SQLite statements at WARN (wekan/wekan#6480). FerretDB already timed every statement but only logged it at DEBUG, so a pathologically slow query left no trace in ordinary logs — exactly the "100% CPU, everything slow, nothing in the logs" situation from #6480. `internal/util/fsql` now emits a `slow query: <statement>` WARN line, carrying the elapsed time and the threshold, for any statement (in both `db.go` and `tx.go`, plain and in-transaction) at or above a threshold. The threshold defaults to 1s and is tunable with the `FERRETDB_SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD` environment variable (a Go duration such as `500ms` or `2s`; a value of `0` or less disables slow-query logging), so a performance problem that FerretDB cannot remediate automatically becomes an actionable, self-describing log line. Covered by `internal/util/fsql/slow_test.go`: threshold parsing (empty/valid/invalid/zero/negative) and that `logSlow` fires only at or above the threshold, is disabled at `<=0`, and does not panic on a nil logger by @xet7. Thanks to uusijani and xet7.

## [v1.32.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.32.0) (2026-07-18)

### Fixed 🐛

- SQLite backend: raise the default `busy_timeout` from 10s to 30s (wekan/wekan#6480). Under a heavy concurrent write load — e.g. a large WeKan 6.09 → v1 migration inserting hundreds of thousands of cards/activities while users log in — a login's `UPDATE` (WeKan's `login` method → collection2 `updateDocument` → the SQLite backend `UpdateAll`, which wraps its writes in `InTransaction`/`BeginTx`) could not acquire the single SQLite write lock within 10s and failed with `SQLITE_BUSY` ("database is locked (5)"), so **Sign In did nothing** and the same error appeared in the log/login screen. The error code is plain `SQLITE_BUSY (5)`, not an un-retryable snapshot conflict, so the busy handler simply ran out of time; FerretDB deliberately relies on `busy_timeout` rather than explicit retry loops (see `internal/backends/sqlite/sqlite.go`), so it is now given more room (30s) to let a contended write through instead of aborting. An operator-supplied `busy_timeout` `_pragma` still wins, and `SetMaxOpenConns(0)` (unlimited) means the longer wait cannot starve the connection pool. Docs (`website/docs/configuration/flags.md`) and the tests — the `parseURI` table tests (`uri_test.go`) and the applied-`PRAGMA busy_timeout` assertion in `TestDefaults` (`pool_test.go`) — updated to match by @xet7. Thanks to uusijani and xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- `build.sh`: add a "Release FerretDB" menu option (option 15, also `./build.sh release-ferretdb`). It first asks whether the newest version was added to `CHANGELOG.md` and, if not, exits with a reminder to update it; otherwise it reads the new version straight from the top of `CHANGELOG.md` (the first `## [vX.Y.Z]` heading — no version prompt) and then commits everything, tags it with that version and pushes the branch and the tag — `git add --all` → `git commit -m "vX.Y.Z"` → `git push` → `git tag -a "vX.Y.Z"` → `git push origin "vX.Y.Z"` → `git push` — so cutting a release is a single guided menu step by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.31.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.31.0) (2026-07-17)

### Fixed 🐛

- SQLite backend: `collectionCreate` now ADOPTS an orphaned physical table instead of crashing on it (wekan/wekan#6476). The table name is a deterministic hash of the collection name, and the collision check only looked at the IN-MEMORY metadata, so a table could exist on disk while its metadata row was gone — an orphan left by an interrupted MongoDB→FerretDB migration or a crash. `collectionCreate` then ran a plain `CREATE TABLE` (and `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX`) that failed with `table "<db>.<coll>_<hash>" already exists`, and on the index failure it rolled back and DROPPED the orphan (losing its data). Because this path runs from an upsert (`msg_update.go` `updateDocument` → `CreateCollection`), the error surfaced as an *unhandledRejection* in WeKan's SyncedCron, which exited the process — systemd then crash-looped WeKan (restart counter climbing to 99) so **its web port never stayed open** ("Wekan starts but doesn't open a listening port"). Both the table and its index are now created with `IF NOT EXISTS`, so an orphan is re-adopted (same collection, same deterministic table) and its metadata re-registered — startup self-heals instead of crashing by @xet7. Thanks to uusijani, a1bert01 and xet7.

- SQLite backend: push `$in` and `$regex` field filters down to SQLite, not just scalar equality (wekan/wekan#6467, wekan/wekan#6468 follow-up). WeKan's sidebar "Filter by label" (`{labelIds: {$in: [...]}}`) and "Filter by card title" (`{title: {$regex: text, $options: "i"}}`) were not pushed down, so every such filter did `SELECT _ferretdb_sjson FROM <table>` over the WHOLE collection and decoded + regex-matched every row's sjson in Go — minutes on a 53k-card board. `$in` now emits `expr IN (?, …)` (keeping the array-containment arm for non-`_id` fields, since Mongo `$in` also matches an array element), and a **literal** `$regex` emits `expr LIKE ?` so SQLite prunes non-matching rows itself. Superset semantics are preserved (the in-Go filter stays authoritative): `$in` is pushed only when EVERY element is a pushdown-safe string/ObjectID (dropping one would make `IN` a subset), and `$regex` only for a plain ASCII literal with no metacharacters/`LIKE` wildcards and no `x` option — because SQLite's `LIKE` folds case for ASCII only, a non-ASCII literal could MISS a case-insensitive match and drop a card, so those stay in Go. Ranges (`$gt`/`$lte`/…, whose JSON-text ordering is wrong for numbers/dates), `$ne` and non-literal/`$options:"x"` regexes are deliberately NOT pushed by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- SQLite backend: push numeric/date RANGE filters (`$gt`/`$gte`/`$lt`/`$lte`) down to SQLite (wekan/wekan#6467 follow-up; WeKan's "Filter by date"). These were the last common WeKan filter still full-scanning + decoding every card's sjson in Go. Ranges are pushed with the `->>` (SQL-value) accessor instead of `->` (JSON text): `->` compared lexically (`"10" < "9"`), which is why range was not pushed before, but `->>` extracts the value NUMERICALLY. sjson stores int32/int64, doubles and dates all as JSON numbers (a date as its Unix-millis), so `_ferretdb_sjson->>"dueAt" <= ?` with a millis bound is a correct, index-shaped comparison; `{$gte: A, $lte: B}` (WeKan's week filters) emits both arms ANDed. Superset semantics hold (the Go filter stays authoritative): a null/missing/string field yields `NULL`/non-numeric and is pruned — matching Mongo's type-bracketed `$lt`/`$gt` — and only NUMBER/DATE bounds are pushed (string ranges, with collation/serialization subtleties, stay in Go). Verified end-to-end against real storage (`TestQueryRangePushdownDates`): an in-range date is returned while later/null/missing dates are pruned by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- Add an end-to-end Go test for the date range pushdown (`internal/backends/sqlite/collection_test.go`, `TestQueryRangePushdownDates`): it inserts documents with past/future/null/missing `dueAt`, then asserts the backend `Query` (which applies only the pushed WHERE) returns the in-range card and prunes the rest, and that `Explain` reports `FilterPushdown`. This proves `->>` reads sjson's millis-encoded date and compares it numerically — the assumption the range pushdown rests on by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- Add Go table tests, with negative cases, for the `$in`/`$regex` pushdown (`internal/backends/sqlite/query_test.go`): `$in` on `_id` (plain `IN`) and on a non-`_id` array field (`IN` + array arm), a literal `$regex` (incl. one with a space) as `LIKE`, and the negatives that must stay in Go — empty/`unsafe-element`/`unsafe-string` `$in`, metacharacter/non-ASCII/`x`-option `$regex`, and a `$lte` range. `pushdownSafeLiteralSubstring` gates the regex case (non-empty ASCII, no regex metacharacters, no `LIKE` wildcards, pushdown-safe). `go build`, `go vet` and the full `internal/backends/sqlite/...` suites pass with Go 1.25.11 by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- Add a Go regression test for the orphaned-table adoption (`internal/backends/sqlite/metadata/registry_test.go`, `TestCollectionCreateAdoptsOrphanTable`, wekan/wekan#6476): it creates a collection, orphans it (drops the metadata row and forgets it in memory while leaving the physical table + its `_id` index on disk), then asserts `CollectionCreate` succeeds by re-adopting the SAME deterministic table and that the collection is usable (insert round-trips) — where before it errored `table … already exists` and dropped the data. `go build`, `go vet` and the full `internal/backends/sqlite/...` suites pass with Go 1.25.11 by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.30.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.30.0) (2026-07-17)

### Fixed 🐛

- SQLite backend: stop the connection pool from starving under WeKan's cursor load (wekan/wekan#6467, wekan/wekan#6469). The v1.28.0 CPU fix capped BOTH `MaxIdleConns` and `MaxOpenConns` at `2×GOMAXPROCS` (min 4, max 16). That was wrong for `MaxOpenConns`: Meteor keeps a server-side `find` cursor open between `getMore` round-trips, and in FerretDB each open cursor PINS one pooled connection for its entire lifetime. So a handful of parked Meteor cursors exhausted a 16-connection pool, and every other query — login-token lookups, board loads — then blocked waiting for a free connection. Operators saw boards take *minutes* to load and logins fail with *"Must be logged in"* even though CPU was back to normal (the #6468 pushdown had fixed that). `MaxOpenConns` is now left UNLIMITED so connection checkout never starves; SQLite still serialises writers itself, and the anti-thrash benefit is preserved by keeping only a small set of connections WARM via `MaxIdleConns` (still `2×GOMAXPROCS`, min 4, max 16) — which, together with the #6468 filter pushdown that turned WeKan's whole-collection scans into indexed lookups, is what actually keeps the pure-Go SQLite (modernc) allocator/WAL mutexes and the Go GC from thrashing. The in-memory backend is unchanged (still pinned to a single connection, as each in-memory connection is its own database) by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- Add Go tests, with negative cases, for the connection-pool limits (`internal/backends/sqlite/metadata/pool/opendb_test.go`). The pool sizing was extracted into `idleConnLimit(gomaxprocs)` and `configurePool(db, memory)` so it is unit-testable. `TestIdleConnLimit` pins the warm-pool sizing (proportional to `GOMAXPROCS`, floor 4, cap 16, and — negative cases — a non-positive `GOMAXPROCS` never yields less than 4, which would deadlock every query). `TestConfigurePoolDoesNotStarveCheckout` is the #6467/#6469 regression guard: it asserts `MaxOpenConnections == 0` (unlimited) and, behaviourally, checks out 32 connections simultaneously (double the old cap) and requires every checkout to succeed — with the regressed cap of 16 the 17th would block until the deadline. `TestConfigurePoolMemoryIsSingleConn` keeps the in-memory single-connection contract. Verified with Go 1.25.11: `go build ./internal/...` and `go vet ./internal/backends/sqlite/...` are clean and the full `internal/backends/sqlite/metadata/pool` suite passes by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.29.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.29.0) (2026-07-17)

### New Features 🎉

- Accept documents with literal dotted field names (`{"foo.bar": "baz"}`), like MongoDB 3.6+ (wekan/wekan#6473). `Document.ValidateData` rejected every document containing a `.` in any field key at any depth (*"invalid key: … (key must not contain '.' sign)"*), so during WeKan's MongoDB → FerretDB migration every such document — importers, CollectionFS-era metadata, third-party tools can all produce them — failed to insert and, because per-item migration errors are deliberately non-fatal, simply went missing. Dotted keys are now stored and round-tripped literally with MongoDB's own semantics: query and update paths still interpret `.` as a path separator, so a literal dotted key is not addressable by path (exactly as in MongoDB), and the other key rules (`$` prefix, duplicate keys, invalid UTF-8) still reject. Verified end-to-end against a live FerretDB on the SQLite backend with the mongodb driver: top-level and nested dotted keys insert and round-trip, `$set` of a subdocument containing a dotted key works, a dotted-path query does NOT match the literal key, and `$`-prefixed keys are still rejected by @xet7. Thanks to mueschel and xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- Update the document validation tests for the dotted-key change (wekan/wekan#6473): `internal/types/document_validation_test.go` now pins that top-level, nested and array-embedded dotted keys are VALID (with negative cases proving `$`-prefixed dotted keys and duplicate dotted keys still reject), and the `Insert`/`Update` dotted-key diff cases in `integration/diff_05_document_validation_test.go` — which documented the old rejection as a difference from MongoDB — are replaced by a `DottedKeysAccepted` group asserting both databases now behave the same: insert + literal round-trip, nested `$set`, and the dotted-path-query-does-not-match-literal-key negative case. `go build ./cmd/... ./internal/...`, `go vet`, and the `internal/types`, `internal/backends/sqlite/...` and `internal/handler/common` test suites pass by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.

- Add Go table tests, with negative cases, for the `$elemMatch` document/field form (`internal/handler/common/filter_elemmatch_test.go`) — the v1.27.0 fix that un-broke WeKan's board access check on the SQLite backend. Pins: the motivating query `{members: {$elemMatch: {userId: X, isActive: true}}}` matches only when the WHOLE sub-query holds on the SAME array element (satisfying it across two different elements must NOT match), single-field and nested-operator field forms, the operator form (`{$gt: value}`) unchanged, non-array/missing fields and non-document elements never match, and the error cases (`$elemMatch` needs an object; `$text` rejected; `$or` not implemented). Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.28.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.28.0) (2026-07-16)

### New Features 🎉

- SQLite backend: push top-level string/ObjectID equality filters down to SQLite as WHERE clauses (wekan/wekan#6467, wekan/wekan#6468). Previously only a bare `{_id: X}` filter was pushed down, so essentially every real query — e.g. WeKan's `{boardId: X}` on 53k cards — did `SELECT _ferretdb_sjson FROM <table>` over the WHOLE collection and decoded every row's sjson in Go, on every Meteor poll. The WHERE expressions are built exactly like the expression indexes that `Registry.indexesCreate` creates (`_ferretdb_sjson->"field"`), so `_id` lookups now use the unique `_id` index and Mongo-level secondary indexes accelerate their fields. Superset semantics are preserved (the in-Go filter stays authoritative): array containment matches are kept via an index-friendly range arm, and string values whose Go-JSON and SQLite serializations could differ (`<`, `>`, `&`, control characters, U+2028/U+2029) are not pushed down by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/ec485d075fd7f98f8cb97732c6379b3ead9fa436 . Thanks to xet7.
- SQLite backend: cap the per-database connection pool at `2×GOMAXPROCS` (min 4, max 16) instead of 100/100. Meteor opens ~100 sockets, and letting them all run concurrent SQLite scans thrashed the pure-Go SQLite (modernc) allocator/WAL mutexes and the Go GC — a reported 821k futex + 530k nanosleep syscalls per 30 s and 250–400% CPU with 1–2 real users (wekan/wekan#6467). Queueing excess queries in database/sql is far cheaper by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/ec485d075fd7f98f8cb97732c6379b3ead9fa436 . Thanks to xet7.
- SQLite backend: `InsertAll` no longer takes the registry's GLOBAL write lock when the collection already exists — `CollectionCreate` write-locked the whole registry even as a no-op, so every small Meteor write (sessions, activities, login tokens) stalled all concurrent readers (wekan/wekan#6467) by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/ec485d075fd7f98f8cb97732c6379b3ead9fa436 . Thanks to xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- Add Go table tests, with negative cases, for the SQLite filter pushdown (`internal/backends/sqlite/query_test.go`): `TestPushdownSafeString` pins which strings are pushdown-safe (Go-JSON and SQLite `->` must serialize them byte-identically — `<`, `>`, `&`, control characters and U+2028/U+2029 are not), and `TestPrepareWhereClause` pins the exact WHERE clauses and args for `_id` (plain equality, matching the unique `_id` expression index) and top-level equality filters including the array-containment range arm and compound filters, plus negative cases proving dotted paths, `$`-operators, non-string values and unsafe strings stay with the in-Go filter. Verified with Go 1.25.11: `go build ./cmd/... ./internal/...` and `go vet ./internal/backends/...` are clean, and the full `internal/backends/sqlite/...` test suites (sqlite, metadata, pool) pass with the pushdown/pool/lock changes in place by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/64d70a0e21f498978b4ba79b84da5f7f8b89f561 . Thanks to xet7.
- Integration test setup: stop flooding the test output with endless `traces export: Post "http://127.0.0.1:4318/v1/traces": connection refused` lines when no OTel collector is running. The OTel trace exporter is optional tooling (FerretDB's task runner starts a collector in Docker; `build.sh` options 4–6 do not), but `integration/setup/startup.go` created it unconditionally and it retried forever. The setup now probes 127.0.0.1:4318 once with a 1 s TCP dial and skips the exporter with a single log line when nothing is listening; with a collector present, tracing works exactly as before by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/8ca41b0a239e390fffeacc71c0336b1ad076dcb2 . Thanks to xet7.
- Integration test setup: `TestOtelComment` passes also without an OTel collector. Skipping the exporter (previous entry) left Go's global NO-OP tracer provider in place, whose spans carry all-zero trace/span IDs — and `TestOtelComment`, which builds a query comment from the span context, failed with *"invalid span context"*. When no collector is listening, the setup now installs a real SDK tracer provider WITHOUT an exporter (logged as `traces are recorded but not exported`): spans get valid trace/span IDs, nothing is sent anywhere, nothing retries. Verified with build.sh's own flags (`-target-backend=ferretdb-sqlite -target-tls`, no collector): `TestOtelComment` passes. `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk` becomes a direct dependency of the integration module (it was already in the module graph, no version changes) by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/98e3a3cc69a0cc93168425a2c386f6f7625e9094 . Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.27.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.27.0) (2026-07-12)

### New Features 🎉

- Implement the document/field form of the `$elemMatch` query operator (`{arr: {$elemMatch: {field: value, ...}}}`): match array elements that are documents satisfying the WHOLE sub-query on the SAME element. Previously only the operator form (`{arr: {$elemMatch: {$gt: value}}}`) worked — a multi-field field-form expression was rejected with `unknown operator: <field>` (`BadValue`), and a single field fell through to operator parsing and failed the same way. This broke common queries such as WeKan's board access check `{members: {$elemMatch: {userId: X, isActive: true}}}`: on the SQLite backend the board list returned no boards and private boards could not be opened (they worked on MongoDB), because the query was rejected before it ever looked at the data. `filterFieldExprElemMatch` now detects the field form (any non-`$` key) and matches each document array element with `FilterDocument`, leaving the operator form unchanged by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/ad4cc23a5c6a0d41bfd16e2c0a8515fbd3ce3bde . Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.26.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.26.0) (2026-07-11)

### Other Changes 🤖

- Disable telemetry by default and reduce log noise for normal operation. The `--telemetry` flag now defaults to `disable` (was `undecided`, which would otherwise begin reporting to beacon.ferretdb.com after a delay), and the telemetry reporter loop is not started at all, so there is no phone-home and no periodic report/ping overhead. The default log level is now `error` (was `info`) for non-debug builds, so routine activity — listening, per-connection and per-command info — no longer produces log noise; raise it with `--log-level=warn|info|debug` only when diagnosing a problem by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Update the Go toolchain from 1.25.0 to 1.25.11 so the released FerretDB binaries (and the Docker image) are compiled with a patched Go standard library. Quay.io's security scanner flagged 37 fixable `stdlib` advisories against the FerretDB binary bundled into the WeKan image (GO-2026-4601/4602/4603, GO-2026-4864/4865/4869/4870, GO-2026-4946/4947, GO-2026-5037/5038/5039 and others), all fixed in Go ≤ 1.25.11. Bumped the pin in `build.sh` (`GO_VERSION`), `.github/workflows/release-all.yml` (`GO_VERSION`), `Dockerfile` (`golang:1.25.11`) and the `go` directive in `go.mod`, so every build path — the local/CI `build.sh` cross-compile and the `docker.yml` image build — produces a binary with the patched stdlib by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Attach each platform's FerretDB binary to the GitHub Release as an INDIVIDUAL asset (`ferretdb-<arch>` / `ferretdb-<arch>.exe`) instead of packing them all into a single `ferretdb.zip`. `build.sh` now cross-compiles into `./dist/` (menu options 11/12 and `./build.sh dist[-seq|-par]`, replacing the old `zip*` commands), `release-all.yml` uploads every `dist/ferretdb-*` asset separately, and `docker.yml` / `Dockerfile.release` download only the Linux `ferretdb-<arch>` assets they need. Every consumer (the WeKan `release-all.yml` bundle jobs, `docker-compose.yml`, the Sandstorm `build-deps.sh`) now downloads only the one binary for the platform it targets, e.g. `https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/latest/download/ferretdb-amd64`, rather than fetching and unzipping the whole multi-platform archive by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Publish the FerretDB Docker image for every architecture that `ferretdb.zip` ships. The image build was QEMU-emulating the Go toolchain per target, which limited it to five arches (amd64, arm64, ppc64le, s390x, riscv64). Because FerretDB is pure Go with CGO disabled and the final image is `FROM scratch`, the build stage now runs natively on the build platform and cross-compiles (`GOOS`/`GOARCH`/`GOARM` taken from buildx's `TARGET*` args), so buildx emits every Linux architecture in the zip — `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/arm/v7` (armhf), `linux/arm/v5` (armel), `linux/386` (i386), `linux/ppc64le`, `linux/s390x`, `linux/riscv64`, `linux/loong64` — without emulating the compiler by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/fc316435821ec2c4fde962e29ec0099604ccc88b . Thanks to xet7.
- Split Docker publishing into a separate `docker.yml` workflow and remove the Docker job from `release-all.yml`. `docker.yml` builds the multi-arch image from the PREBUILT binaries in the newest (or a chosen) GitHub Release's `ferretdb.zip` — no recompilation and no QEMU — deriving the platform list from the Linux binaries actually present in the release and pushing `:<version>` and `:latest` to Docker Hub, Quay.io and GHCR (the same `DOCKERHUB_AUTH` / `QUAY_AUTH` / `GHCR_AUTH` secrets). Adds `Dockerfile.release`, which selects the prebuilt binary matching the target platform into a `FROM scratch` image, plus a per-Dockerfile `Dockerfile.release.dockerignore` so it does not disturb the source build's context. `release-all.yml` now only builds `ferretdb.zip` and publishes the Release by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/1c6de77071b912759f0746c93d9e2de832c28fd7 . Thanks to xet7.
- Build the GitHub Release notes in `release-all.yml` from three parts: a fixed header line (`FerretDB v1 (SQLite) multi-platform binaries — ferretdb.zip. Built by release-all.yml from the wekan/FerretDB fork.`), then a `Platforms: ...` line listing every architecture present in `ferretdb.zip` (read from its `ferretdb/<arch>/` entries, in `build.sh`'s canonical order with any extras appended), then the `CHANGELOG.md` `## [<version>]` section for the release. `ferretdb.zip` is built before the notes are composed so the platform list reflects exactly what shipped by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/549edcc62b00875e6b6681373efb61e6815462fd . Thanks to xet7.
- Harden `docker.yml`: push to Docker Hub, Quay.io and GHCR in separate `buildx` calls so one registry's failure (for example a Quay robot account that only has Read permission, which lets `docker login` succeed but returns 401 on the blob push) no longer aborts the pushes to the other registries; every push is reported in its own log group and the job still fails at the end if any of them failed, but the registries that succeeded are published. Also drop the non-Linux binaries (`win*`, `mac-*`, `freebsd-*`) and `README.md` from the extracted release before building so the Docker build context contains only the Linux binaries that are actually used (down from ~833 MB) by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/252a10996bbf4e1bb3731341d61fd412d3406e72 . Thanks to xet7.
- Add a `build.sh` menu option 14 (and `./build.sh docker-release [version]`) that triggers the `docker.yml` workflow — building the multi-arch image from a release's prebuilt binaries and pushing to Docker Hub, Quay.io and GHCR — alongside the existing option 13 (`release-all.yml`). Both share a `trigger_workflow` helper that pushes the current branch and runs the workflow with `gh` by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/a570a69626cd6faf4775bc8ea72b84469aed4763 . Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.25.0](https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.25.0) (2026-07-10)

### New Features 🎉

- Implement the `replSetInitiate` command as a compatibility no-op so that tools and drivers that bootstrap a replica set do not hard-fail: the command is accepted with or without a configuration document (`{replSetInitiate: 1}` or `{replSetInitiate: {_id: "rs0", members: [...]}}`) and returns `{ok: 1}`, echoing back the configuration `_id` (replica set name) when one is supplied. IMPORTANT: this does NOT set up real replication — FerretDB v1's oplog is tailing-only and must still be configured manually by creating a capped `local.oplog.rs` collection and setting the `FERRETDB_REPL_SET_NAME` environment variable; the command creates no oplog, elects no primary and does not change server topology by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/ed98fa8eda6b4fad0a1f8de4ce7d6d7572a14a01 . Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the logical session and transaction command family as compatibility commands so MongoDB drivers (and Meteor) that rely on sessions and retryable writes work against the SQLite backend: `startSession` returns a session record with a freshly generated UUID, and `commitTransaction`, `abortTransaction`, `endSessions`, `refreshSessions`, `killSessions`, `killAllSessions` and `killAllSessionsByPattern` return `{ok: 1}`. The ordinary write commands (`insert`, `update`, `delete`, `findAndModify`) now also accept and ignore the retryable-write / session fields `autocommit`, `startTransaction`, `stmtId` and `stmtIds` in addition to the already-accepted `lsid` and `txnNumber`. IMPORTANT: these transaction commands are NO-OP compatibility commands — FerretDB v1 with the SQLite backend has no real multi-document transactions, every write auto-commits on its own, and the commands provide no atomicity or isolation across operations (`abortTransaction` does not roll back writes that already happened); logical sessions are accepted but carry no server-side state by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/c229095a16dc18b840d1cd676c67b0c821bb80ba . Thanks to xet7.
- Track logical sessions in a real server-side session registry (ported and adapted from FerretDB v2's `internal/handler/session` package) instead of treating the session commands as pure no-ops: the handler now owns a `session.Registry` that creates and looks up sessions by `lsid`, groups them per user, records their created and last-used times, marks sessions as ended and prunes ended/expired sessions after the 30-minute `LogicalSessionTimeoutMinutes`. `startSession` registers a fresh session, `endSessions` marks the referenced sessions ended, `refreshSessions` bumps their last-used time (creating them implicitly if needed), and `killSessions`, `killAllSessions` and `killAllSessionsByPattern` remove the referenced sessions from the registry — all still returning `{ok: 1}`. The v2 cursor-association tracking is intentionally omitted because v1's cursor registry differs, so the port keeps the session lifecycle only. IMPORTANT: this only tracks session bookkeeping — multi-document transactions remain NO-OP compatibility commands, as FerretDB v1 with the SQLite backend auto-commits every write and provides no atomicity or isolation by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/166770d28c574e0a772bf379a75710ed00c0294c . Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the `$setWindowFields` aggregation stage together with the window operators `$rank`, `$denseRank`, `$documentNumber` and `$shift` (rank/position, requiring `sortBy`) and the window accumulators `$sum`, `$avg`, `$min`, `$max`, `$count`, `$push`, `$first`, `$last`, `$stdDevPop` and `$stdDevSamp` (over the default full-partition window or an explicit `window: {documents: [lower, upper]}` with integer offsets and the `"unbounded"`/`"current"` keywords). The window operators `$derivative`, `$integral`, `$expMovingAvg`, `$covariancePop`, `$covarianceSamp`, `$linearFill`, `$locf`, `$minN`/`$maxN` and `range` windows are deferred and return a clear not-implemented error by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/540de307697b74ed6f6dcb1ae0bffb499d039081 . Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the `$slice`, `$sort` and `$position` modifiers for the `$push` update operator (used by WeKan) by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the `$eq`, `$ne`, `$or`, `$ifNull`, `$anyElementTrue`, `$objectToArray` and `$map` aggregation expression operators used by WeKan by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the `$cmp`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`, `$and`, `$not`, `$cond`, `$switch` and `$allElementsTrue` aggregation expression operators by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the arithmetic aggregation expression operators `$add`, `$subtract`, `$multiply`, `$divide`, `$mod`, `$abs`, `$ceil`, `$floor`, `$trunc`, `$round`, `$pow`, `$sqrt`, `$exp`, `$ln`, `$log`, `$max`, `$min` and `$avg` by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the trigonometric, hyperbolic, angle-conversion and `$log10` aggregation expression operators `$sin`, `$cos`, `$tan`, `$asin`, `$acos`, `$atan`, `$atan2`, `$sinh`, `$cosh`, `$tanh`, `$asinh`, `$acosh`, `$atanh`, `$degreesToRadians`, `$radiansToDegrees` and `$log10` by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/62a683ebcd2cb7b657fa66bdd41fe9640e57d7bf . Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the `$bsonSize` aggregation expression operator, which returns the size in bytes of the BSON encoding of a document (null for a null argument) by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/84d798e69bcce8e355305d573a09a8b19df405b1 . Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the string aggregation expression operators `$concat`, `$toUpper`, `$toLower`, `$strLenCP`, `$strLenBytes`, `$strcasecmp`, `$substr`, `$substrCP`, `$substrBytes`, `$split`, `$trim`, `$ltrim`, `$rtrim`, `$indexOfCP`, `$indexOfBytes`, `$replaceOne`, `$replaceAll` and `$regexMatch` by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the array aggregation expression operators `$size`, `$arrayElemAt`, `$concatArrays`, `$isArray`, `$in`, `$reverseArray`, `$slice`, `$range`, `$indexOfArray`, `$arrayToObject`, `$filter`, `$reduce`, `$sortArray`, `$setUnion`, `$setIntersection`, `$setDifference`, `$setEquals`, `$setIsSubset` and `$zip` by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the type-conversion aggregation expression operators `$toString`, `$toInt`, `$toLong`, `$toDouble`, `$toBool`, `$toObjectId`, `$toDate`, `$convert`, `$isNumber`, `$literal`, `$let`, `$getField`, `$setField`, `$unsetField`, `$binarySize` and `$rand` by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the date aggregation expression operators `$year`, `$month`, `$dayOfMonth`, `$hour`, `$minute`, `$second`, `$millisecond`, `$dayOfWeek`, `$dayOfYear`, `$week`, `$isoDayOfWeek`, `$isoWeek`, `$isoWeekYear`, `$dateToString`, `$dateFromString`, `$dateToParts`, `$dateFromParts`, `$dateAdd`, `$dateSubtract`, `$dateDiff` and `$dateTrunc` by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the `$lookup` aggregation stage (basic equality-join form) used by WeKan by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the `$replaceRoot`, `$replaceWith`, `$sortByCount` and `$sample` aggregation stages by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the `$facet` aggregation stage (multi-sub-pipeline) by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the `$unionWith` aggregation stage (with optional sub-pipeline) by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the `$bucket` and `$bucketAuto` aggregation stages (the `$bucketAuto` `granularity` option is not yet supported) by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Implement TTL indexes (`expireAfterSeconds` on createIndexes, reported by listIndexes, with a background reaper that deletes expired documents) by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the `$where` query operator, which evaluates a JavaScript expression or function against each document (with `this` bound to the document) using the embedded pure-Go goja JavaScript engine by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/dd4dafe7ff21734a2308fb75691b2c9e330d2d69 . Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the `$function` aggregation expression operator (`{body, args, lang: "js"}`), which runs a user-supplied JavaScript function over the evaluated argument expressions using the embedded pure-Go goja JavaScript engine by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/dd4dafe7ff21734a2308fb75691b2c9e330d2d69 . Thanks to xet7.
- Implement text indexes: `createIndexes` now accepts the `"text"` index key value and the `weights`, `default_language`, `language_override` and `textIndexVersion` options, storing them so the index is created and round-tripped through `listIndexes` (weights default to 1 per field). Note that this is a pragmatic implementation for compatibility: no real inverted/full-text index is built by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/21ed80281959b7c074c6f12be3003e8557f0bac7 . Thanks to xet7.
- Implement the `$text` query operator with partial, self-contained semantics: it matches the `$search` terms directly against a document's string fields (recursing into sub-documents and arrays) and supports multi-term OR, case-insensitive whole-word matching, `$caseSensitive`, double-quoted phrases and leading `-` negation; `$language` and `$diacriticSensitive` are accepted and ignored. There is no stemming, no relevance scoring and no `$meta: "textScore"` projection by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/21ed80281959b7c074c6f12be3003e8557f0bac7 . Thanks to xet7.
- Accept the `hidden`, `collation`, `partialFilterExpression` and `2dsphere` index options on `createIndexes`: `hidden` (bool), `collation` (document) and `partialFilterExpression` (document) are stored and round-tripped through `listIndexes`, and the `"2dsphere"` index key value together with `2dsphereIndexVersion` is accepted and reported (version defaulting to 3). These options are only accepted, stored and reported — FerretDB does not hide indexes from the query planner, does not apply locale-aware collation, does not restrict a partial index to matching documents and does not run geospatial queries. The remaining options (`storageEngine`, `bits`, `min`, `max`, `bucketSize`, `wildcardProjection`) still return not-implemented by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/13e8f22896d52ad98c4c5fc2496ce19d068188aa . Thanks to xet7.

### Other Changes 🤖

- Add a `release-all.yml` GitHub Actions workflow that does a full FerretDB v1 release: it builds `ferretdb.zip` for every platform with `build.sh`, publishes a GitHub Release with it at https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/releases, and builds + pushes a multi-arch FerretDB Docker image (amd64, arm64, ppc64le, s390x, riscv64) from the source Dockerfile to `wekanteam/ferretdb`, `quay.io/wekan/ferretdb` and `ghcr.io/wekan/ferretdb` — using the same `DOCKERHUB_AUTH` / `QUAY_AUTH` / `GHCR_AUTH` base64("user:token") secrets as wekan/wekan by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/67262f0a02d94bcbe2a47bd6831b56ed7f3beb2f . `build.sh` gains option 13 / `./build.sh release [version]` to push the branch and trigger that workflow via `gh`, like wekan/wekan's `releases/release-all.sh`. Thanks to xet7.
- Add `build.sh` menu options 11 (**SEQUENTIAL**) and 12 (**PARALLEL**) — and the non-interactive `./build.sh zip` / `zip-seq` / `zip-par` commands — that cross-compile FerretDB v1 (SQLite backend, `CGO_ENABLED=0`, no QEMU) for every platform Go and `modernc.org/sqlite` support into a single `ferretdb.zip` with the layout `ferretdb/<arch>/ferretdb-<arch>` (`.exe` only on Windows, binaries already `chmod +x`) plus `ferretdb/README.md`; targets that do not compile are skipped, so the zip holds exactly what builds. The build was run and all 16 targets compiled: amd64, arm64, armhf, armel, i386, ppc64le, s390x, riscv64, loong64, win64, win-arm64, win32, mac-amd64, mac-arm64, freebsd-amd64, freebsd-arm64. Go's build scratch dir (`GOTMPDIR`) is placed on the repo disk so a parallel build does not fill a small `/tmp` tmpfs, and `.gitignore` ignores the produced `ferretdb.zip` by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/05fa6ee1123071c63eee0cbec6a0c777b7eef276 . Thanks to xet7.
- Fix the SQLite backend unit tests after the `modernc.org/sqlite` bump: the embedded SQLite moved from 3.46.0 to 3.53.2, so update the expected `sqlite_version()` / `BackendVersion` (3.46.0 → 3.53.2) and `sqlite_source_id()` in `pool_test.go`, `registry_test.go` and `backend_test.go`, and run `build.sh` unit tests with `-tags=ferretdb_debug` (the tag `task test-unit` uses) so the debug-only assertions pass — e.g. `TestCheckError`, which asserts `debugbuild.Enabled` by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/e566dee9b54a8558bc6b50343bdffa51189c0e4e . Thanks to xet7.
- Add an interactive `build.sh` helper for FerretDB v1 (SQLite): a menu-driven (and non-interactive `./build.sh <command>`) script to install dependencies, build the `ferretdb` binary with the SQLite handler, run FerretDB on the SQLite backend, run the in-process SQLite integration tests (with the required `-target-tls` flag), run unit tests, vet, build/run the Docker stack, and clean; it self-installs a local Go 1.25 toolchain under `./.goroot` when `go` is not on `PATH`. Integration tests can be run **sequentially** (`test-seq`, `-p 1 -parallel 1`) or in **parallel** (`test-par [N]` / `TEST_PARALLEL=N`, defaulting to the CPU count) by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/adc3473d . Thanks to xet7.
- Add positive and negative integration tests for the `$pullAll` update operator, used by WeKan (already implemented upstream) by @xet7. Thanks to xet7.
- Add `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` so `docker compose up --build` builds FerretDB v1 (SQLite backend) and runs WeKan against it (no oplog, `METEOR_REACTIVITY_ORDER=polling`, attachments on filesystem); the previous FerretDB development compose is preserved as `docker-compose.dev.yml` by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/ed7a4df1 . Thanks to xet7.
- Update all Go dependencies to their latest releases (grpc, protobuf, OpenTelemetry, `golang.org/x/{crypto,net,sys,text}`, `go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver`, testify and procfs) and bump the `go` directive from 1.24 to 1.25 by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/7549f63d311e499c3136a9eac9efed874bccbf6a . Thanks to xet7.
- Update the SQLite backend driver `modernc.org/sqlite` v1.32.0 → v1.53.0 (and `modernc.org/libc` v1.55.3 → v1.74.0), which requires Go 1.25 by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/7549f63d311e499c3136a9eac9efed874bccbf6a . Thanks to xet7.
- Keep `github.com/FerretDB/wire` pinned at v0.0.8, because newer releases change the internal BSON API (`GetByIndex`, `Sections`, `CheckNaNs`) used by this v1.24.2 codebase by @xet7 in https://github.com/wekan/FerretDB/commit/7549f63d311e499c3136a9eac9efed874bccbf6a . Thanks to xet7.

## [v1.23.0](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.23.0) (2024-07-25)

### What's Changed

#### Embeddable package

This release switches from the [`zap` logging package](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) to the standard [`slog`](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog).
If the logger was configured by Go programs that import [`github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/ferretdb` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/ferretdb), they should configure the `SLogger` field instead.
Setting the old `Logger` field will make the program panic and make the issue immediately noticeable.

The next release will completely remove `zap` and rename `SLogger` to just `Logger`.

#### Initial OpenTelemetry tracing support

This release adds initial support for sending OpenTelemetry traces to the OTLP endpoint.
The set of spans and their attributes is not stable yet and will change over time.

All improvements in observability in this release (OpenTelemetry traces, Kubernetes probes, debug archive)
are documented [there](https://docs.ferretdb.io/configuration/observability/).

#### Experimental Systemd configuration in `.deb` and `.rpm` packages

This release adds initial unit files for `systemd` that auto-start FerretDB.
They are likely to change in the future in incompatible ways; for example, we may switch to using a non-root user.

## [v1.18.0](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.18.0) (2024-01-08)

### What's Changed

#### Capped collections

This release adds support for capped collections.
They can be created as usual using `create` command.
Both `max` (maximum number of documents) and `size` (maximum collection size in bytes) parameters are supported.

#### Tailable cursors

This release adds support for tailable cursors.
Both `tailable` and `awaitData` parameters are supported.

#### OpLog tailing

This release adds support for the basic OpLog functionality.
The main supported use case is Meteor's OpLog tailing.
Replication is not supported yet.

OpLog collection does not exist by default.
To enable OpLog functionality, create a capped collection `oplog.rs` in the `local` database.
Setting replica set name using [`--repl-set-name` flag / `FERRETDB_REPL_SET_NAME` environment variable](https://docs.ferretdb.io/configuration/flags/#general)
might also be needed.

## [v1.13.0](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.13.0) (2023-10-23)

### What's Changed

#### New PostgreSQL backend

The new PostgreSQL backend is now enabled by default.
You can still enable the old backend with `--postgresql-old` flag or `FERRETDB_POSTGRESQL_OLD=true` environment variable,
but it will be removed in the next release.

#### Default SQLite directory for Docker images

Our Docker images (but not binaries and `.deb` / `.rpm` packages) now use `/state` directory for the SQLite backend.
That directory is also a Docker volume, so data will be preserved after the container restart by default.

#### `arm/v7` packages

We now provide `linux/arm/v7` binaries, Docker images, and `.deb` / `.rpm` packages.

## [v1.12.1](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.12.1) (2023-10-10)

### What's Changed

#### New PostgreSQL backend

The new PostgreSQL backend is ready for testing.
Enable it with `--postgresql-new` flag or `FERRETDB_POSTGRESQL_NEW=true` environment variable.
The next FerretDB version will enable it by default.

#### Docker images changes

Production Docker images use `scratch` as a base Docker image.
The only file present in the image is a FerretDB binary (with root TLS certificates embedded).

#### `arm64` binaries

In addition to `linux/arm64` Docker images, we now provide `linux/arm64` binaries and `.deb` / `.rpm` packages.

## [v1.5.0](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.5.0) (2023-07-03)

### What's Changed

This release provides beta-level support for the SQLite backend.
There is some missing functionality, but it is ready for early adopters.

This release provides improved cursor support, enabling commands like `find` and `aggregate` to return large data sets much more effectively.

Tigris data users: Please note that this is the last release of FerretDB which includes support for the Tigris backend.
Starting from FerretDB v1.6.0, Tigris will not be supported.
If you wish to use Tigris, please do not update FerretDB beyond v1.5.0.
This and earlier versions of FerretDB with Tigris support will still be available on GitHub.
