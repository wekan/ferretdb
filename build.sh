#   ./build.sh <command>    # run one action non-interactively, e.g.:
#   ./build.sh deps | build | run | goenv | unit | lint | docker | clean
#   ./build.sh no-lfs                  # fail if anything is stored in Git LFS (also part of lint)
#   ./build.sh dist                    # build all per-arch binaries, sequential (default)
#   ./build.sh dist-seq                # build all per-arch binaries, one platform at a time
#   ./build.sh dist-par                # build all per-arch binaries, all platforms in parallel
#   ./build.sh release [version]       # trigger release-all.yml (per-arch binaries + GitHub Release)
#   ./build.sh release-ferretdb        # full release: rename Upcoming, tag + push, then run release-all.yml (-> docker.yml)
#   ./build.sh docker-release [version]# trigger docker.yml (multi-arch image to registries)
#   ./build.sh test                    # integration tests, parallel (default)

# ---- run GitHub Actions workflows ----------------------------------------

# `version` input, so this shared helper handles both.
#   trigger_workflow <workflow-file> [version]
#
# Requirements so this dispatches automatically (instead of you clicking
# "Run workflow" in the Actions tab):
#   1. `gh` installed and authenticated for github.com (`gh auth login`, or a
#      GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN env var).
#   2. The token must be able to dispatch workflows. A classic PAT needs the
#      `workflow` scope (plus `repo`); a fine-grained PAT / GitHub App token needs
#      Actions: write. A classic token with only `repo` returns 403 "Resource not
#      accessible" — the usual silent cause; fix that one with
#      `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s workflow`. We do NOT pre-flag the scope,
#      because `gh auth status` does not report the capability for fine-grained /
#      app tokens (which dispatch fine) — so a pre-check gives false 403 warnings.
#      A real permission error surfaces in the final error message below instead.
